the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault
of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

aggregate principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 (the &#147;new DT notes&#148;) directly from the Issuer with no underwriting discount. DT has agreed that the payment for the new DT notes will be made by delivery of $1.25&nbsp;billion in
aggregate principal amount of 8.097% Senior Reset Notes due 2021 (the &#147;2021 notes&#148;) and $1.25&nbsp;billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.195% Senior Reset Notes due 2022 (the &#147;2022 notes&#148;) held by DT and to have been called
for redemption, in exchange for the new DT notes. In connection with such exchange, the Issuer will pay DT in cash the premium portion of the redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the 2021 notes and the 2022 notes, plus accrued but
unpaid interest on the 2021 notes and the 2022 notes to, but not including, the exchange date. The closing of the issuance and sale of the new DT notes to DT, and exchange of the 2021 notes and 2022 notes, is expected to occur on or about
April&nbsp;30, 2018. The new DT notes will have substantially the same terms and conditions as each of the 2026 notes and 2028 notes, as applicable, other than issue date, issue price, registration rights and CUSIP. In addition, the new DT notes
will be issued under separate supplemental indentures and will each constitute a separate series from the notes offered hereby for all purposes, including voting; provided that if the Issuer exercises its rights in respect of a series of notes
offered hereby, the Issuer will be required to exercise the same rights in respect of the new DT notes of the corresponding series on an equal and ratable basis. </P>

In this description of notes, &#147;<I>Issuer</I>&#148; refers only to T-Mobile USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its Subsidiaries, and &#147;<I>Parent</I>&#148; refers only to T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the
direct parent company of Issuer, and not to any of its Subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Issuer will issue $2,500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of
notes in this offering as two separate series: $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes due 2026 (the &#147;<I>2026 notes</I>&#148;) and $1,500,000,000&nbsp;in aggregate principal amount of notes due 2028 (the &#147;<I>2028
notes</I>&#148; and together with the 2026 notes, the &#147;<I>notes</I>&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Issuer will issue the notes under that certain base
indenture (the &#147;<I>base indenture</I>&#148;) among itself, Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the &#147;<I>trustee</I>&#148;), dated April&nbsp;28, 2013, as supplemented with respect to each
series of notes, by a supplemental indenture (for each such series, the &#147;<I>supplemental indenture</I>&#148;) among Issuer, Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the trustee. In this description of notes, the term &#147;<I>indenture</I>&#148;
refers to the base indenture as supplemented separately by the supplemental indenture for each series of notes. The terms of the notes of each series include those stated in the indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the &#147;<I>Trust Indenture Act</I>&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The obligations and covenants of Issuer described
hereunder are only of Issuer and not of Parent. Although Parent is a guarantor of the notes, it and its Subsidiaries, except Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, are generally not subject to any of the obligations and covenants described
hereunder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the indenture in its
entirety. We urge you to read the indenture in its entirety because it, and not this description of notes, defines your rights as a holder of the notes. For more information on how you can obtain a copy of the base indenture and supplemental
indenture, see &#147;Where You Can Find More Information.&#148; Certain defined terms used in this description of notes but not defined below under &#147;&#151;Certain Definitions&#148; have the meanings assigned to them in the indenture. </P>

notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases or
other prepayments on Issuer. In the event a Change of Control Triggering Event or Asset Sale occurs at a time when Issuer is prohibited from purchasing notes, Issuer could seek the consent of the holders of such Indebtedness to the purchase of notes
or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that case, Issuer&#146;s failure to purchase tendered
notes would constitute an Event of Default under the applicable indenture that could, in turn, constitute a default under the other Indebtedness. Finally, Issuer&#146;s ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by
