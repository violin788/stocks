the Outside Date (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) to November&nbsp;1, 2019, or, if the Marketing Period (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) has started and is in effect at such date, then January&nbsp;2, 2020. The
Amendment also provides that the closing of the Merger Transactions will occur on the first business day of the first month (other than the third month of any calendar quarter) where such first business day is at least three business days following
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the closing of the Merger Transactions, or, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of such satisfaction or waiver, the closing shall occur on the earlier of (a)&nbsp;any date during

third month of any calendar quarter) where such first business day is at least three business days following the final day of the Marketing Period. The Amendment also modifies the Business Combination Agreement so as to limit the actions the parties
may be required to undertake or agree to in order to obtain any remaining governmental consents or avoid an action or proceeding by any governmental entity in connection with the Merger Transactions, recognizing the substantial undertakings already

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bellevue, Washington and Overland Park, Kansas &#150; July 26, 2019 &#150; <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Sprint
Corporation (NYSE: S) today announced they have taken an important step toward completing their proposed merger to create the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> by entering into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ). The DOJ action moves the merger one step closer to closing, pending other regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The companies also announced agreements with DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ: DISH) in which the combined <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT>
and Sprint, as the proposed New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> will divest Sprint&#146;s prepaid&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sprint&#146;s 800 MHz&nbsp;spectrum assets&nbsp;to DISH.&nbsp;Additionally, upon the closing of the
divestiture transaction, the companies will provide DISH wireless customers access to the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> network for seven years and offer standard transition services arrangements to DISH during a transition
period of up to three years.&nbsp;DISH will also have an option to take on leases for certain cell sites and retail locations that are decommissioned by the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile,</FONT> subject to any assignment
restrictions. The transactions with DISH are contingent on the successful closing of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile&#146;s</FONT> merger with Sprint among other closing conditions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> and Sprint merger we announced last April will create a bigger and bolder competitor than ever
before &#151; one that will deliver the most transformative 5G network in the country, lower prices, better quality, unmatched value and thousands of jobs, while unlocking an unprecedented $43B net present value in synergies. We are pleased that our
previously announced target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation have not changed,&#148; said <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CEO and New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile</FONT> CEO John Legere. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Today marks an incredibly important step forward for the New <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">T-Mobile.</FONT> We are ready to bring this supercharged <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Un-carrier</FONT> to consumers and businesses across the country, and this milestone brings us much closer to making that vision a reality for customers everywhere!&#148; said Legere.&nbsp;&#147;Our goal was to ensure that
the DOJ&#146;s concerns were addressed while enabling us to deliver on every aspect of the synergies we promised to unlock&#133; and we did it. It may have taken longer than expected by some, but today&#146;s results are a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">win-win</FONT> for everyone involved. We cannot wait to get to work bringing this <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-consumer,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-competition</FONT> New <FONT

most important,&nbsp;American consumers and businesses,&#148; said Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure. &#147;Today&#146;s clearance from the DOJ, along with our anticipated approval from the FCC, will allow the U.S. to fiercely
compete&nbsp;for 5G leadership.&nbsp;We plan to build one of the world&#146;s most advanced 5G networks, which will massively revolutionize the way consumers and businesses&nbsp;use their connected devices to enhance their daily lives. The powerful
combination of 5G, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things will unleash endless possibilities.&#148; </P>
