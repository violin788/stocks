decline that together constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event, offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date

unutilized Excess Proceeds (not only the amount in excess of $100.0 million) to make an Asset Sale Offer pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.10 of the Base Indenture to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is <I>pari passu</I> with
the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes (including any Additional Notes) and
purchase or redeem such other <I>pari passu</I> Indebtedness that may be purchased or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and such other <I>pari passu</I>
Indebtedness that may be purchased or redeemed with Excess Proceeds thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the date of consummation of the purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the

Subsidiary) may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other <I>pari passu</I> Indebtedness tendered in response to such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount
of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and the Company shall select such other <I>pari passu</I> Indebtedness to be purchased or redeemed on a <I>pro rata</I> basis unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or
depositary requirements. Holders of Notes that are the subject of an offer to purchase will receive an Asset Sale Offer from the Company prior to any related purchase date and may elect to have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled
&#147;Option of Holder to Elect Purchase&#148; attached to the Notes. </P>

redemption of Notes, any such notice of redemption may, at the Company&#146;s discretion, state that such redemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if such notice of redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Company&#146;s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion), or such

that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the Notes shall become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
