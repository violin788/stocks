Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;), has entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated December
18, 2017, with American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent (the &ldquo;Rights Agreement&rdquo;) in an effort
to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that the Company&rsquo;s ability to use its net operating losses
(collectively, the &ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited
(the &ldquo;Tax Benefits&rdquo;). All capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Rights Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">The
Rights Agreement is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company&rsquo;s
outstanding Common Stock (as defined below) without the approval of the Board of Directors (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). Stockholders
who beneficially own 4.9% or more of the outstanding Common Stock as of the close of business on December 18, 2017 will not trigger
the Rights Agreement so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock representing 0.5%
or more of the outstanding Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock) at a time
when they still beneficially own 4.9% or more of the outstanding Common Stock. In addition, the Board retains the sole discretion
to exempt any person or group from the penalties imposed by the Rights Agreement.</FONT></P>

Board remains open to all alternatives to maximize stockholder value, and may in its sole discretion exempt a proposed acquisition
of Common Stock from the Rights Agreement, including if it determines that the acquisition is in the Company&rsquo;s best interests,
or if it will not jeopardize the tax benefits of the NOLs. The Rights Agreement is not expected to interfere with any merger or
other business combination approved by the Board.</FONT></P>

Rights</I>. The Board authorized the issuance of one right (a &ldquo;Right&rdquo;) for each outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the &ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;) payable to stockholders of record as of the close
of business on January 2, 2018 (the &ldquo;Record Date&rdquo;). One Right will also be issued together with each share of our
Common Stock issued after January 2, 2018 but before the Distribution Date (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, after
the Distribution Date. Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, if the Rights become exercisable,
each Right would initially represent the right to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the &ldquo;Series A Preferred Stock&rdquo;) for a purchase price
of $40.00 (the &ldquo;Purchase Price&rdquo;). If issued, each one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock would give
the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of Common Stock. However, prior
to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, any dividend,
voting or liquidation rights. A copy of the Certificate of Designation (the &ldquo;Certificate of Designation&rdquo;) filed by
the Company with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 18, 2017 to designate the Series A Preferred Stock
is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.</FONT></P>

earlier date as a majority of the Board becomes aware of the existence of an Acquiring Person, the Board may redeem the Rights

(ii) will entitle holders to preferential cumulative quarterly dividends in an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal

power as one share of Common Stock, and (v) will entitle holders to a per share payment equal to the payment made on one share
of Common Stock, if shares of the Common Stock are exchanged via merger, consolidation, or a similar transaction. Because of the
nature of the Series A Preferred Stock&rsquo;s dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of a Unit of Series A Preferred
Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock.</FONT></P>

that those changes do not impair or adversely affect any Rights holder (other than an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate

in this Section 20, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>Bensenville,
IL, December 18, 2017</B>&nbsp;&mdash; Rubicon Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: RBCN) announced today that its Board of Directors has
adopted a stockholder rights plan in the form of a Section 382 Rights Agreement designed to preserve its substantial tax assets.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">As
of December 31, 2016, Rubicon had federal and state net operating loss (&ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) carryforwards of approximately $148
million and $180 million, respectively, which could be used in certain circumstances to offset Rubicon&rsquo;s future taxable
income or otherwise payable taxes and therefore reduce its federal and state income tax liabilities. Rubicon&rsquo;s plan is similar
to plans adopted by numerous other public companies with significant net operating loss carryforwards.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">Rubicon&rsquo;s
ability to use NOLs would be substantially limited in the event of an &ldquo;ownership change&rdquo; under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related U.S. Treasury regulations. In general, an ownership change would occur if Rubicon&rsquo;s
stockholders who own, or are deemed to own, 5% or more of Rubicon&rsquo;s common stock increase their collective ownership in
Rubicon by more than 50% over a rolling three-year period. The stockholder rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of
an unintended ownership change occurring through the buying of Rubicon common stock and&nbsp;is not meant to be an anti-takeover
measure.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">As
part of the plan, on December 18, 2017, Rubicon&rsquo;s Board declared a dividend of one preferred-share-purchase-right for each
share of Rubicon common stock outstanding as of January 2, 2018. Effective today, if any person or group acquires 4.9% or more
of the outstanding shares of Rubicon common stock, or if a person or group that already owns 4.9% or more of Rubicon common stock
acquires additional shares representing 0.5% or more of the outstanding shares of Rubicon common stock, then, subject to certain
exceptions, there would be a triggering event under the plan. The rights would then separate from the Rubicon common stock and
would be adjusted to become exercisable to purchase shares of Rubicon common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price, resulting in significant dilution in the ownership interest of the acquiring person or group.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">Rubicon&rsquo;s
Board has the discretion to exempt any acquisition of Rubicon common stock from the provisions of the plan if it determines that
doing so would not jeopardize or endanger Rubicon&rsquo;s use of its tax assets. Rubicon&rsquo;s Board also has the ability to
terminate the plan prior to a triggering event, including but not limited to in connection with a transaction, if it determines
that doing so would be in the best interests of Rubicon&rsquo;s stockholders.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">The
rights issued under the plan will expire on December 18, 2020. The rights may also expire on an earlier date if certain events
occur, as described more fully in the Section 382 Rights Agreement that Rubicon will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">The
issuance of the&nbsp;rights&nbsp;is not a taxable event and will not affect Rubicon&rsquo;s reported financial conditions or results
of operations (including earnings per share). Rubicon&rsquo;s stockholders do not have to take any action to receive their&nbsp;rights&nbsp;under
the&nbsp;plan, and no separate&nbsp;rights&nbsp;certificates will be distributed until after the&nbsp;rights&nbsp;become exercisable.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">Additional
information regarding the rights agreement&nbsp;is included in the Current Report on Form 8-K and the Registration Statement on
Form 8-A filed today by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Rubicon stockholders of record as
of January 2, 2018 will be sent a summary of the rights.</FONT></P>
