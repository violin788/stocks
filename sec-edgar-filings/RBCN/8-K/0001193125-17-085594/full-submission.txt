<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Rubicon Technology Appoints Susan M. Westphal as Independent Director </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bensenville, Illinois &#150; March&nbsp;16, 2017 &#150; Rubicon Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: RBCN) announced today that it has concluded its search for a new CEO
and appointed Timothy E. Brog, as Chief Executive Officer, effective March&nbsp;17, 2017. Mr.&nbsp;Brog has been a director of Rubicon since May 2016. Mr.&nbsp;Brog replaces Bill Weissman, who has resigned as Chief Executive Officer and President
effective March&nbsp;17, 2017. Mr.&nbsp;Weissman has also resigned as a member of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors effective March&nbsp;17, 2017. Mr.&nbsp;Weissman will serve as a consultant to Rubicon Technology under terms to be agreed upon.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Don Aquilano, Chairman of the Board of Directors, said, &#147;The Board looks forward to working with Timothy on his ideas relating to the core sapphire
business, the sale of real estate and excess assets and our previously stated desire to explore various alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including potentially through acquiring an existing business, establishing&nbsp;a new venture, or
other investment opportunities in order to utilize our substantial net operating losses. He is an accomplished executive, with extensive investment, legal, management and financial experience. We welcome his insights as we pursue the appropriate
path forward to drive long-term stockholder value. I also want to thank Bill for his tireless effort on behalf of Rubicon during a very challenging period where global excess capacity of sapphire drove prices to record low levels, particularly in
two high volume markets, LED and mobile devices.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, effective March&nbsp;17, 2017, Rubicon Technology appointed Susan M. Westphal as a
new independent director of the Company. Ms.&nbsp;Westphal is the Chief Counsel of Melissa and Doug, LLC, a leading designer and manufacturer of educational toys and children&#146;s products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ms.&nbsp;Westphal said, &#147;I look forward to working with the Board and Timothy Brog, Rubicon&#146;s new Chief Executive Officer, on the Company&#146;s
efforts to implement change and maximize stockholder value. I am excited to work with Rubicon as we seek to strengthen the Company&#146;s existing Sapphire business, capitalize on new opportunities and position Rubicon for the future.&#148; </P>
