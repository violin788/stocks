statements&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may be identified by the use of words such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;should,&#148;
&#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;believe&#148; and &#147;plan.&#148; The forward-looking statements contained in this Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K</FONT> include, without limitation, statements related to the planned
Acquisition and the timing and financing thereof. These and other forward-looking statements are based on management&#146;s current views and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Results
may be materially affected by factors such as: risks associated with acquisitions generally, such as the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, required approvals under applicable antitrust legislation and other regulatory and third party
consents and approvals; failure to retain key management and employees of the Acquired Business; issues or delays in the successful integration of the Acquired Business&#146; operations with those of McCormick, including incurring or experiencing
unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties; difficulties or delays in the successful transition of the Acquired Business&#146; business from the information technology systems of the Sellers to those of McCormick as well as risks associated
with other integration or transition of the operations, systems and personnel of the Acquired Business, each, as applicable, within the term of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> post-closing transition services agreement between
McCormick and the Sellers under the Acquisition Agreement; future levels of revenues being lower than expected and costs being higher than expected; failure or inability to implement growth strategies in a timely manner; unfavorable reaction to the
Acquisition by customers, competitors, suppliers and employees; conditions affecting the industry generally; local and global political and economic conditions; conditions in the securities market that are less favorable than expected; and changes
in the level of capital investment, and other risks described in McCormick&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including McCormick&#146;s Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for the year ended

specified on the face hereof, &#147;Business Day&#148; means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close

specified on the face hereof, &#147;Business Day&#148; means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close

successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the Stated
Maturity Date shown above (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to the Stated Maturity Date) and to pay interest, if any, thereon at the Interest Rate shown above from the Original Issue Date shown above or from the most recent Interest
Payment Date to which interest, if any, has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each year (each, an &#147;Interest Payment Date&#148;) until the principal hereof is paid or made available for
payment and on the Stated Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or Repayment Date (such terms are together hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Maturity Date&#148; with respect to the principal repayable on such date); provided, however, that any
payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, to be made on any Interest Payment Date or on the Maturity Date that is not a Business Day (as defined below) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and
effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be, and no additional interest, if any, shall accrue on the amount so payable as a result of such delayed payment. For purposes of this Security, unless otherwise
specified on the face hereof, &#147;Business Day&#148; means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close

Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is the euro, such day is also a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer

such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the &#147;Special Record Date&#148;) for the payment

specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, in respect of this Security in such Specified Currency by delivery of a written request to the corporate trust office of the Trustee in St. Paul, Minnesota,
currently the office of the Trustee located at U.S. Bank, Global Corporate Trust Services, 111 Fillmore Avenue E, St. Paul, Minnesota 55107, or at such other office as the Company may determine, on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or
at least fifteen days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or by electronic mail or other form of facsimile transmission. The Holder hereof may elect to receive payment in such
Specified Currency for all principal, premium, if any, and interest payments, if any, and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of
any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least fifteen days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. </P>

within the international banking community, then the Holder hereof may not so elect to receive payments in the Specified Currency and any such outstanding election shall be automatically suspended, until the Company determines that the Specified

any adjustment be made to any amount payable hereunder as a result of any change in the value of the Specified Currency shown above relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates. </P>

is a Foreign Currency, and the Holder has elected to receive payments in such Specified Currency as provided for above, such interest payments will be made by transfer of immediately available funds, but only if appropriate wire transfer
instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date. Simultaneously with any election by the Holder hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency (if other than U.S.
dollars), such Holder may provide appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee, and all such payments will be made in immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank, but only if such bank has appropriate

redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at the option of the Company at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount hereof plus accrued interest to the date of redemption which has not been paid. The Company
may exercise its redemption options by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities
