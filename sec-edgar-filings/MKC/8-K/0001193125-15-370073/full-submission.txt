&#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters (as listed and defined in Schedule

Exhibit 1.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Closing </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;6, 2015, the Company closed the offering of the Notes pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The offer and sale of the Notes

issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of July&nbsp;8, 2011, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), pursuant to which the Company may issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time
to time in one or more series. A copy of the Indenture was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company&#146;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) on July&nbsp;8, 2011, and is incorporated
by reference herein. A copy of the form of Notes is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;4.2 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at the redemption price described in the Notes. Additionally, at the option of the holders of the Notes, the Company may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the
Notes of a holder upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the Indenture, at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the date of repurchase. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Indenture provides, among other things, that the Notes will be unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of payment to
all of the Company&#146;s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability
of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the Indenture, to create or incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Indenture also imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company to merge or
consolidate with or into any other person or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the property of the Company in any one transaction or series of related transactions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among
others: nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture, defaults in or failure to pay certain other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other material terms of the Notes and the Indenture are described in the prospectus supplement filed by the Company with the Commission on
