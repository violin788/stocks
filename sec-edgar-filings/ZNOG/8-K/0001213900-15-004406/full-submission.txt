INDEMNIFICATION</U></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">Section 1. <U>General</U>.
Each person who at any time shall serve or shall have served as a Director or officer of the Corporation, or any person who, while
a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be entitled to (a) indemnification and (b) the advancement
of expenses incurred by such person from the Corporation as, and to the fullest extent, provided for under Article Ninth of the
Certificate of Incorporation and permitted by Section&nbsp;145 of the DGCL or any successor statutory provision, as from time to
time amended. The Corporation may indemnify any other person, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations specified
in the immediately preceding sentence, by reason of the fact that such other person is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation
or, at the request of the Corporation, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. The foregoing
right of indemnification and advancement of expenses provided shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors
of the Corporation or otherwise, both as to action in such person&rsquo;s official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U> shall be deemed to be a contract between
the Corporation and the director, officer, employee or agent who served in such capacity at any time while this <U>Article&nbsp;VI,
</U>Article Ninth of the Certificate of Incorporation and other relevant provisions of the DGCL and other applicable law, if any,
are in effect. Any repeal or modification hereof or thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing. Without limiting
the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U>, the Corporation is authorized from time to time, without further action by the stockholders
of the Corporation, to enter into agreements with any director or officer of the Corporation providing such rights of indemnification
as the Corporation may deem appropriate, up to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any agreement entered into by the Corporation
with a director may be authorized by the other directors, and such authorization shall not be invalid on the basis that similar
agreements may have been or may thereafter be entered into with other directors.</P>

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation, or, at the request of the Corporation, a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any
such capacity, or arising out of such person&rsquo;s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have had the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the applicable provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;VI, </U>Article Ninth of the
Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Section 1. <U>Certificates For Shares</U>.
Certificates representing shares of stock of the Corporation, whenever authorized by the Board of Directors, shall be in such form
as shall be approved by the Board. The certificates representing shares of stock shall be signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation
by the Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary or an Assistant secretary or the Treasurer
or an Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation, and sealed with the seal of the Corporation (if one has been adopted), which may
be by a facsimile thereof. Any or all such signatures may be facsimiles. Although any officer, transfer agent or registrar who
has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate ceases to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such officer, transfer
agent or registrar were still such at the date of issue. The certificates shall be consecutively numbered and shall be entered
in the books of the Corporation as they are issued and shall exhibit the holder&rsquo;s name and the number of shares. To avoid
any doubt, shares of stock of the Corporation need not be represented by certificates, but may be uncertificated and reflected
by book entry only.</P>

of the Corporation or a transfer agent for such stock, if any, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares
properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose
name shares stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security and not absolutely,
and written notice thereof shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent, such fact shall be stated in the entry of
the transfer. No transfer of shares shall be valid as against the Corporation, its stockholders and creditors for any purpose until
it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.</P>

post office address, if any, as the same appears on the stock record books of the Corporation or at such person&rsquo;s last known
post office address.</P>

Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates</U>. The holder of any share of stock of the Corporation shall immediately notify the Corporation
of any loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of the certificate therefor. The Corporation may issue to such holder a new certificate
or certificates for shares, upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or, in the case of loss, theft or destruction of the
certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate or certificates representing shares
to be lost or destroyed. The Board of Directors, or a committee designated thereby, may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or such person&rsquo;s
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as it may direct to indemnify
the Corporation and said transfer agents and registrars against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.</P>
