<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On March 19, 2012,
Zion Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and Victor G. Carrillo entered into an amended and restated employment agreement.
The restated employment agreement, which was due to Mr. Carrillo&rsquo;s appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer in
October 2011, was approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors. Under the agreement, Mr. Carrillo
continues to be paid an annual salary of $250,000, subject to annual review and adjustments. By its terms, the agreement provided
for an initial term ending December&nbsp;31, 2013. After expiration of the initial term, the agreement automatically renews for
two successive one year periods, terminated by either party upon notice to the other, given not less than 30&nbsp;days prior to
the expiration of the then-current term.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The agreement provides
that, during each year that the agreement remains in effect, Mr. Carrillo is entitled to fully vested stock options to purchase
up to 25,000 shares of our common stock at a per share exercise price of $0.01, issuable in December of such year or, if the agreement
is terminated prior to end of such terms, then options for a pro-rated amount of shares of common stock is to be issued at the
time of termination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Either the Company
or Mr. Carrillo can terminate the employment agreement and the relationship thereunder at any time upon notice. If during the initial
term the Company were to terminate the agreement for any reason other than &quot;Just Cause&quot; (as defined in the employment
agreement), then the Company is to pay to Mr. Carrillo three month&rsquo;s salary, as well as all benefits earned and accrued through
such date; if the Company were to terminate the agreement during a renewal term, then Mr. Carrillo is entitled to six month&rsquo;s
salary, as well as all benefits earned and accrued through such date. The employment agreement provides for customary protections
of the Company's confidential information and intellectual property.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">(a)&#9;<B><U>Arbitration</U></B>. Except
as provided in Section (b) below, I agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to any interpretation, construction,
performance or breach of this Intellectual Property Agreement, shall be settled by arbitration to be held in Dallas, Texas, in
accordance with the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association, provided however, the parties will be entitled
to full and liberal evidentiary discovery in accordance with the rules governing civil litigation in courts of the same jurisdiction.
The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision in any court
having jurisdiction. The Company will pay the costs and expenses of such arbitration, and each of us shall separately pay our counsel
fees and expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">(b)&#9;<B><U>Equitable Remedies</U></B>.
Each of the Company and I agree that disputes relating to or arising out of a breach of the covenants contained in this Intellectual
Property Agreement would likely require injunctive relief to maintain the status quo of the parties pending the appointment of
an arbitrator pursuant to this Intellectual Property Agreement. The parties hereto also agree that it would be impossible or inadequate
to measure and calculate the damages from any breach of the covenants contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement prior to
resolution of any dispute pursuant to arbitration. Accordingly, if either party claims that the other party has breached any covenant
of this Intellectual Property Agreement, that party will have available, in addition to any other right or remedy, the right to
obtain an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and/or to specific performance
of any such provision of this Intellectual Property Agreement pending resolution of the dispute through arbitration. The parties
further agree that no bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and hereby consents to the issuance
of such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance. However, upon appointment of an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall
review any interim, injunctive relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction and shall have the discretion, jurisdiction,
and authority to continue, expand, or dissolve such relief pending completion of the arbitration of such dispute or controversy.
The parties agree that any orders issued by the arbitrator may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction if necessary
to ensure compliance by the parties.</P>
