the Underwriter at a price of $21.06 per share to the Underwriter, and the Underwriter agreed to
purchase for resale to the public in an at-the-market offering (the &#147;Public Offering&#148;), subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, 3,000,000 shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock.
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is

which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information
contained in the Registration Statement or included or would include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at that subsequent time, not
misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriter and will promptly amend or supplement,
at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict,
untrue statement or omission.

that such an offering will confer upon the undersigned as a shareholder and an officer and/or
director of the Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, with each underwriter to be named in the Underwriting Agreement that, during a period
of 90&nbsp;days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement (the &#147;Lock-Up Period&#148;), the undersigned will
not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, directly or indirectly, (i)&nbsp;offer,
pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or

transfer any shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the
undersigned or with respect to which the undersigned has or hereafter acquires the power of
disposition (collectively, the &#147;Lock-Up Securities&#148;), or exercise any right with respect to the
registration of any of the Lock-up Securities, or file or cause to be filed any registration
statement in connection therewith, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii)&nbsp;enter into
any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Lock-Up Securities, whether any such swap
or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or
otherwise.
