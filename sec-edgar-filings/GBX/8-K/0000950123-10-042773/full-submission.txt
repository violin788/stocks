<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;29, 2010, WL Ross-Greenbrier Rail I LLC (&#147;Rail I&#148;), created for the purpose of
acquiring railcar assets in North America to be exclusively managed by subsidiaries of The
Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), acquired a lease portfolio of nearly 4,000 railcars
valued at approximately $230&nbsp;million. Rail I is owned by affiliates of Wilbur J. Ross, Jr., a
director of the Company, and WLR IV Parallel ESC, L.P. (&#147;Parallel Fund&#148;) and WLR Recovery Fund IV,
L.P. (&#147;Fund IV&#148;), the holders of warrants to acquire 3,377,907, or approximately 16.5%, of our
outstanding common stock, as described more fully below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the acquisition of the lease portfolio of nearly 4,000 railcars, on April
29, 2010, Greenbrier Leasing Company LLC (&#147;GLC&#148;) and Greenbrier Management Services, LLC (&#147;GMS&#148;),
subsidiaries of the Company, entered into certain agreements with affiliates of Wilbur J. Ross,
Jr., Parallel Fund and Fund IV: a Contract Placement Agreement, Advisory Services Agreement, a
Syndication Agreement, a Railcar Remarketing and Management Agreement and Line of Credit
Participation Letter Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a Contract Placement Agreement between WLR-Greenbrier Rail Inc. (&#147;WLR Inc.&#148;) and
GLC, GLC paid WLR Inc. a fee of approximately $6&nbsp;million as an inducement to cause WLR Inc., or WLR
Inc. to cause its affiliates, to enter into an Advisory Services Agreement, a Syndication
Agreement, a Railcar Remarketing and Management Agreement and Line of Credit Participation Letter
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Railcar Remarketing and Management Agreement (the &#147;Management Agreement&#148;) GMS was
appointed exclusive manager and remarketer of the portfolio of railcars, and will receive a
management fee to be set forth in agreed upon supplements to the Management Agreement. Pursuant to
the initial supplement for the nearly 4,000 railcars, GMS will receive a management fee equal to a
percentage of gross revenues generated by the railcar leases and gross proceeds from the sale of
railcars. Unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances, each supplement terminates on either
the date set forth in the supplement or when all railcars under the Supplement are disposed. The
term of the initial supplement is 25&nbsp;years. GLC has provided a performance guaranty for
performance of GMS under the Management Agreement. GMS previously provided limited management
services for approximately 2,500 of such 4,000 railcars.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Syndication Agreement GLC was appointed as the exclusive agent for the purpose of
seeking investors to purchase an interest in a portion of WLR Inc.&#146;s interest in, or newly issued
equity interests of, WLR Inc.&#146;s subsidiary, WL Ross Greenbrier Rail Holdings I LLC (&#147;Holdings&#148;),
the parent corporation of Rail I. In return, GLC will receive a fee customary in the industry to
be mutually agreed upon by the parties. The term of the Syndication Agreement continues until the
earlier of liquidation or dissolution of Holdings, any sale of all of WLR Inc.&#146;s interest in
Holdings or any foreclosure by the senior lenders on the assets of Rail I.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Advisory Services Agreement GLC was appointed as an exclusive consultant to WLR Inc.
to provide WLR Inc. advice with respect to the railcar industry, including the railcar leasing
industry and other matters. GLC shall receive incentive

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">compensation equal to a percentage, which may increase in certain circumstances, of the
distributions of Holdings to WLR Inc. related to the performance of the railcar leasing portfolios
owned by its subsidiaries. In addition, GLC is entitled to a success fee payable upon closing of
an issuance, sale or other transfer of any interests of Holdings or Rail I to a third-party equal
to a percentage of the amount paid by such third party for the interest, less certain expenses.
The term of the agreement continues until the sale, liquidation or dissolution of Holdings and Rail
I. WLR Inc. may also engage GLC to assist with refinancing indebtedness of Rail I in which case
GLC shall be appointed as the exclusive consultant.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Line of Credit Participation Letter Agreement GLC has the right to participate in up
to $2.625&nbsp;million of funding under the line of credit extended by WLR Inc. to Rail I in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transactions described herein are considered related party transactions. Parallel Fund
and Fund IV are shareholders of WLR Inc. Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, is the managing member of El Vedado, LLC, the general partner of WL Ross Group,
L.P., which in turn is the managing member of WLR Recovery Associates IV LLC, the general partner
of Fund IV. Mr.&nbsp;Ross is the Chief Executive Officer of Invesco Private Capital, Inc., the managing
member of Invesco WLR IV Associates LLC, which is in turn the general partner of Parallel Fund.
Mr.&nbsp;Ross and Wendy Teramoto, a member of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, are executive officers
of WL Ross &#038; Co. LLC and other of its affiliates, including WLR Inc., Rail I and Holdings. On June
10, 2009, WL Ross &#038; Co. LLC and other of its affiliates extended a secured term loan to the Company
in an amount equal to $75&nbsp;million, which is due on June&nbsp;10, 2012.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WLR Inc. and the Company intend to seek additional opportunities to acquire railcar lease
portfolios utilizing this structure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact dollar value of the above transactions cannot readily be determined as it is based
on a number of variables that have not yet been achieved or measured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;28, 2010, the above transactions were approved by a majority of the disinterested and
independent directors of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors which found that the financial terms of
the above transactions are no less favorable to the Company, GLC and GMS, as applicable, than those
which could be obtained at the time of the transactions in an arm&#146;s-length transaction with a
person that is not an affiliate of the Company. The Board of Directors received a fairness opinion
from an independent appraisal firm that the financial terms of the transactions in the
aggregate, including the consideration paid by GLC in relation to the benefits received, are fair
to the Company, including GLC and GMS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain confidential commercial and financial information regarding the agreements described
above has been omitted and such information and agreements have been filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a Confidential Treatment Request under Rule&nbsp;24b-2 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
