 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Item&nbsp;2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangement of a Registrant. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;20, 2014, Greenbrier Leasing Company LLC (&#147;<U>GLC</U>&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (&#147;<U>Registrant</U>&#148;), entered into a Credit Agreement (the &#147;<U>Credit Agreement</U>&#148;) with Bank of America, N.A. (&#147;<U>BofA</U>&#148;), as Administrative Agent, Union Bank, N.A., as Syndication
Agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Manager, and the lenders identified therein (the &#147;<U>Lenders</U>&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders made a $200.0 million senior secured term loan (&#147;<U>Term Loan</U>&#148;) to GLC, as the borrower. A portion
of the proceeds from the Term Loan were used by GLC to refinance the principal and interest outstanding under two existing senior term loans in the aggregate amount of approximately $125.0 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Term Loan is subject to a borrowing base which is determined based on the net book value of certain pledged railcar assets and GLC is obligated to make
mandatory prepayments if the borrowing base ratio exceeds the required threshold. To secure its obligations under the Credit Agreement, GLC granted the Lenders a security interest in the railcar assets (and related proceeds) included in the
borrowing base. The Term Loan is to be repaid in 23 equal quarterly installments of $1.75 million each, commencing June&nbsp;30, 2014, with the remaining outstanding amounts, plus accrued interest, to be paid on the maturity date of March&nbsp;20,
2020. GLC may make voluntary prepayments without penalty and there is an accordion provision permitting an increase to the Term Loan up to a maximum of $50.0 million subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan bear interest at a &#147;Base Rate&#148; or a &#147;Eurocurrency Rate&#148;, at the option of GLC, plus an amount
equal to the &#147;Applicable Margin&#148; under the Term Loan. Pursuant to an interest-rate SWAP contract also entered into on March&nbsp;20, 2014, GLC locked in a fixed rate of 1.9875% in place of its otherwise floating Eurocurrency Rate for
approximately half of the Term Loan (or $100.0 million, reducing over the term of the facility to $79,875,000), which, together with the Applicable Margin at closing of 1.75% (subject to adjustment under the terms of the Term Loan), equated to an
all-in rate at closing for such portion of the Term Loan of 3.7375%. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, dispositions, restricted payments, transactions
with affiliates, liens, fundamental changes, sale and leaseback transactions and other restrictions applicable to GLC and its subsidiaries and GLC is required to comply with a Consolidated Adjusted Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined therein) and a
Consolidated Capitalization Ratio (as defined therein). The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, such as non-payment, covenant breaches and the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The description of the Credit Agreement in this Current Report on Form 8-K is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Credit
Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BofA, Union Bank, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated and the Lenders have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending and/or commercial banking services, or other services for GLC, the
Registrant and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and expense reimbursement. </P>
