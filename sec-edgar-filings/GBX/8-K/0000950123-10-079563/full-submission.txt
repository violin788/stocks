<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;18, 2010, Greenbrier Leasing Company LLC (&#147;GLC&#148;), a subsidiary of The Greenbrier
Companies, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) and WLR-Greenbrier Rail Inc. (&#147;WLR Inc.&#148;) entered into an amendment
(&#147;Amendment&#148;) of the Syndication Agreement dated April&nbsp;29, 2010 (&#147;Syndication Agreement&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Syndication Agreement GLC was appointed as the exclusive agent for the purpose of
seeking investors to purchase an interest in a portion of WLR Inc.&#146;s interest in, or newly issued
equity interests of, WLR Inc.&#146;s subsidiary, WL Ross-Greenbrier Rail Holdings I LLC (&#147;Holdings&#148;),
the parent corporation of WL Ross-Greenbrier Rail I LLC (&#147;Rail I&#148;). Pursuant to the Amendment, GLC
paid Holdings a $130,000 fee to delete certain obligations of GLC that would require registration
as a broker dealer under the federal and state securities laws and agreed to pay Holdings
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Amendment. GLC will
continue to provide certain specialized services to WLR Inc. under the Syndication Agreement, for
which WLR Inc. will be compensating GLC upon the terms set forth in the Syndication Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with certain services originally contemplated by the Syndication Agreement,
Holdings is entering into an engagement letter dated August&nbsp;18, 2010 (the &#147;Engagement Letter&#148;) with
GSF Capital Markets, LLC (the &#147;Beneficiary&#148;), and the Beneficiary is simultaneously entering into a
Registered Representative Agreement with an employee of GLC in connection therewith (the
&#147;Registered Representative Agreement&#148; and, together with the Engagement Letter, the &#147;Agreements&#148;).
Under the Engagement Letter, the Beneficiary will act as placement agent with respect to the sale
of membership interests in Holdings. Pursuant to the Amendment, GLC has agreed to indemnify
Holdings to the extent Holdings is required to indemnify the Beneficiary under the Engagement
Letter. The Beneficiary has made it a condition of the Agreements that the Company also provide a
guarantee of the obligations of Holdings pursuant to the Engagement Letter, and on August&nbsp;18, 2010,
the Company entered into a Guaranty (&#147;Guaranty&#148;) for the benefit of the Beneficiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Guaranty, the Company guarantees to the Beneficiary the due and punctual performance
of all of the obligations of Holdings arising under or pursuant to the Agreements, including
payment and indemnity. The Company is contingently liable under the Guaranty and could become
directly liable for payment and performance under the Engagement Letter if Holdings defaults on its
obligations thereunder. The exact dollar value of the above transactions cannot readily be
determined as it is based on a number of variables that have not yet occurred or cannot yet be
measured and depends, in part, upon the amount of funds raised by Holdings from a new investor or
investors, as contemplated by the Agreements. The maximum potential amount of future payments that
the Company could be required to make under the Guaranty is unable to be determined at this time.
The Company&#146;s liability, if any, under the Guaranty could exceed the ultimate purchase price of the
sale of membership interests in Holdings eventually sold. The Company believes the likelihood of
the Company being required to make payments pursuant to the Guaranty is remote. For accounting
purposes, the Company will be required to establish a fair value on the Guaranty and the Company
currently believes the fair value of the Guaranty is immaterial. The Guaranty is accounted for as
an &#147;off balance sheet arrangement.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transactions described herein are considered related party transactions. WLR IV Parallel
ESC, L.P. (&#147;Parallel Fund&#148;) and WLR Recovery Fund IV, L.P. (&#147;Fund IV&#148;) are shareholders of WLR
Inc., which is the sole member of Holdings. Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, is the managing member of El Vedado, LLC, the general partner of WL Ross Group,
L.P., which in turn is the managing member of WLR Recovery Associates IV LLC, the general partner

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AMENDMENT TO SYNDICATION AGREEMENT (this &#147;Amendment&#148;) is made August&nbsp;18, 2010 by and
between each of Greenbrier Leasing Company LLC, an Oregon limited liability company (&#147;GLC&#148;) and
WLR-Greenbrier Rail Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;WL Ross&#148;).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Reference is made to that certain Syndication Agreement dated as of April&nbsp;29, 2010 by and
between GLC and WL Ross (the &#147;Syndication Agreement&#148;), providing for, among other things, GLC
acting as exclusive agent to WL Ross in connection with the sale of an interest in the membership
interests in WL Ross-Greenbrier Rail Holdings I LLC (&#147;Holdings&#148;), or the issuance of new membership
interests in Holdings, to one or more entities (collectively, the &#147;Transaction&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;GLC and WLR wish to amend the terms of the Syndication Agreement to remove any obligation
of GLC that would require registration as a broker dealer under the federal and state securities
laws in connection with the Transaction. GLC will continue to provide specialized services which
do not require registration as a broker dealer to WL Ross under the Syndication Agreement that will
be used by WLR in furtherance of the Transaction, for which WL Ross will be compensating GLC upon
the terms set forth in the Syndication Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;WL Ross is willing to permit such amendment in exchange for payment of $130,000 from GLC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;In connection with such amendment, GSF and WL Ross&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Holdings,
will be entering into a separate broker agreement with GSF governing the terms and conditions of
services to be provided by GSF to WL Ross and Holdings (the &#147;Broker Agreement&#148;) and an agreement
with respect to services to be provided in connection therewith by Brian Conn, an employee of GLC
(or its affiliates) (the &#147;Registered Representative Agreement&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in
the Syndication Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the mutual agreement
