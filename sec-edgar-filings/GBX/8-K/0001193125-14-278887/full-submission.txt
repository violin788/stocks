(&#147;<U>Watco</U>&#148;, Greenbrier and Watco are referred to herein collectively as the &#147;<U>Members</U>&#148;) completed the formation of their previously announced 50/50 joint venture (the &#147;<U>Joint Venture</U>&#148;) of the
Member&#146;s railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance businesses. With 38 railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance shops, 14 of which also perform tank car repairs, the Joint Venture is one of the largest independent railcar repair shop
networks in North America ranked by the number of locations and geographic diversity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In this regard, on July&nbsp;18, 2014 the Members entered into a
Contribution Agreement (the &#147;<U>Contribution Agreement</U>&#148;) pursuant to which each Member contributed assets in exchange for their membership interests in the Joint Venture and each Member executed the Amended and Restated Limited
Liability Company Agreement (the &#147;<U>Limited Liability Company Agreement</U>&#148;) of GBW Railcar Services Holdings, L.L.C. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Contribution
Agreement </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, each Member contributed $10 million cash at closing and other assets (including intangible personal
property, intellectual property, customer lists, goodwill and other intangibles) to the Joint Venture and agreed to lease to the Joint Venture real and personal properties which had been previously used by such Member in its railcar repair
businesses in exchange for the membership interests in the Joint Venture. Each Member also sold their repair inventory to the JV at its book value. In addition, each Member committed to making an additional $5.0 million capital contribution to the
Joint Venture in the near term. The Contribution Agreement contains customary terms, conditions, representations and warranties, including representations and warranties regarding each Member&#146;s respective railcar repair businesses and the
assets contributed to the Joint Venture or otherwise leased to or to be operated by the Joint Venture after the closing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Contribution
Agreement, each of Greenbrier and Watco retained their pre-closing accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other pre-closing liabilities and obligations. In the Contribution Agreement, the Members agreed to cooperate with respect to warranty
obligations and the collection of accounts receivable, and other matters. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Limited Liability Company Agreement </I></P>

Watco and two managers appointed by Greenbrier. The voting power of the managers is based on the Members&#146; relative sharing ratios (currently 50/50) as determined in the Limited Liability Company Agreement and the agreement sets out the
necessary votes by the managers and the members for certain actions and contains terms for resolving deadlocks. The Limited Liability Company Agreement provides for the approval by the Managers of the Joint Venture of an annual business plan, which
plan is to provide for the Joint Venture&#146;s anticipated funding needs for operations and capital expenditures, and other matters. In addition to the initial </P>

contributions described above, each Member is required to fund the Joint Venture through additional capital contributions and/or loans to the Joint Venture as provided for in the annual business
plan and Limited Liability Company Agreement. Interest on outstanding Member loans to the Joint Venture is set at LIBOR plus the highest margin for LIBOR loans made under either Greenbrier or Watco loan agreements plus 100 basis points. The Joint
Venture is to make quarterly distributions to the Members as provided for in the Limited Liability Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Limited Liability Company Agreement
contains provisions concerning dispute resolutions, the disposition of membership interests, including restrictions on dispositions, buy-sell provisions, rights of first refusal and other provisions. The agreement expressly permits certain affiliate
transfers and pledges and permits one Member to purchase the interests of another Member upon the occurrence of certain events. In the Limited Liability Company Agreement, the Members agreed not to engage in the railcar repair business in North
America while they are members of the Joint Venture and for a term of two years thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Credit Agreement </U></P>

Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto (&#147;<U>Credit Agreement</U>&#148;). The Fourth Amendment amends certain financial covenants and their
