 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;29, 2015, (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (&#147;Greenbrier&#148;) entered into a Third Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (&#147;BofA&#148;), as Administrative Agent, MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (&#147;MUFG Union Bank&#148;), as Syndication Agent, Bank of the West, Fifth Third Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(&#147;Wells Fargo&#148;), as Co-Documentation Agents, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated, as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, and the lenders identified therein (the &#147;Amended Credit Facility&#148;), which
Amended Credit Facility amends and restates the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June&nbsp;30, 2011, as amended, entered into by Greenbrier, BofA as Administrative Agent, and the other parties thereto. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Effective Date, Greenbrier and its material U.S. Subsidiaries (the &#147;Subsidiary Guarantors&#148;) entered into a Third Amended and Restated
Security Agreement (the &#147;Amended Security Agreement&#148;) and Third Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (the &#147;Amended Pledge Agreement&#148;) under which each of Greenbrier and the Subsidiary Guarantors granted the lenders security
interests in the collateral securing their obligations under the Amended Credit Facility. In addition, the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into a Third Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guaranty under which they guaranteed the obligations of Greenbrier
under the Amended Credit Facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amended Credit Facility allows Greenbrier to borrow, on a revolving basis, up to $550.0 million based on
availability under a borrowing base formula. The Amended Credit Facility provides for additional incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million, subject to customary deliveries and approvals, including Greenbrier board
approval, as more fully set forth in the Amended Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility matures on October&nbsp;29, 2020, at which time all amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Greenbrier and the Subsidiary Guarantors, excluding the stock and assets of
certain foreign subsidiaries and assets previously pledged as security for existing term loans, as more fully set forth in the Amended Credit Facility, the Amended Security Agreement and the Amended Pledge Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Advances under the Amended Credit Facility are limited by a borrowing base formula consisting of a percentage of eligible domestic assets including inventory,
receivables, leased railcars and property, plant and equipment. Outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility), plus one of the
following indexes: (i)&nbsp;LIBOR and (ii)&nbsp;for Dollar-denominated loans only, the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (a)&nbsp;the Bank of America &#147;prime rate&#148;, (b)&nbsp;the Federal Funds rate plus .50% and (c)&nbsp;a daily
rate equal to (1)&nbsp;one-month LIBOR (for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency), (2)&nbsp;the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (for loans denominated in Canadian dollars), or (3)&nbsp;the Interbanking Equilibrium Interest Rate (for loans
denominated in Mexican Pesos), in each case (1)&nbsp;through (3)&nbsp;plus 1.0%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amended Credit Facility contains customary representations,
warranties and covenants, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, dispositions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, liens, fundamental changes, sale and leaseback transactions and other restrictions. The Amended Credit
Facility also requires Greenbrier to comply with a Consolidated Adjusted Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) covenant and a Consolidated Capitalization Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) covenant. It
also contains customary events of default, which include the occurrence of any Change of Control (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility). If an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted in the Amended Credit Facility, the
Administrative Agent may terminate the commitments under the Amended Credit Facility, accelerate any outstanding loans under the Amended Credit Facility and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to 105% of the lenders&#146; letter of credit
exposure plus interest thereon under the Amended Credit Facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The descriptions of the Amended Credit Facility, the Amended Security Agreement and the
Amended Pledge Agreement in this Current Report on Form 8-K are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the Amended Credit Facility, the Amended Security Agreement and the Amended Pledge Agreement, as applicable, copies of
which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BofA, MUFG Union Bank, Bank of the West, Fifth Third
Bank, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated and certain of the other lenders under the Amended Credit Facility have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking,
financial advisory, lending and/or commercial banking services, or other services for Greenbrier and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and expense reimbursement. </P>

Greenbrier issued a press release announcing, among other things, that the Board of Directors authorized Greenbrier to repurchase up to an additional $100 million of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program first
approved in October 2014 with authorization to purchase up to $50 million of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock, and adjusted in January 2015 through a $25 million increase to the share repurchase program. This latest authorization brings the total
amount that Greenbrier is authorized to purchase under the share repurchase program to an aggregate total of $175 million. Through the date hereof, Greenbrier has purchased approximately $72.5 million of stock under this program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the share repurchase program, shares of common stock may be purchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time-to-time.
The timing and amount of purchases will be based upon market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors. The share repurchase program does not obligate Greenbrier to acquire any specific number of shares in any period. The additional
authorization under the share repurchase program expires January&nbsp;1, 2018, but may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. </P>

Chairman and CEO, said, &#147;We continued to realize positive operating momentum in the fourth quarter, leading to record revenue, margin and earnings for both the quarter and fiscal year as a whole. We intend to build on this operating momentum,
using the strength of our integrated model and our diversified high margin new railcar backlog, some of which stretches into 2020. We expect these factors will lead to another solid year of earnings and free cash flow in fiscal 2016.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;While recent new railcar order activity has been dampened by broad economic factors, it is too early to determine whether the level of
new orders will continue at this muted pace. We are an agile company and, if needed, we are ready to adapt quickly to market conditions. We remain optimistic about the long term fundamentals and drivers of new railcar demand,&#148; Furman continued.
&#147;Industry forecasts support this view, with above long-term average levels of new railcar deliveries expected in North America through 2019. Our strategy to diversify our product offerings, create efficient, flexible manufacturing capacity in
low-cost facilities, drive more value through our lease syndication model, and increase revenue diversity in international markets, along with our strong balance sheet, positions us well.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are actively expanding our geographic reach and now sell into more global markets than ever before,&#148; Furman added. &#147;Most
recently, we announced our entry into markets in the Middle East with an order for 1,200 tank cars from Saudi Railway Company (SAR). Earlier this year, we expanded into South American markets through our investment in a Brazilian railcar
manufacturer, now known as Greenbrier-Maxion. Greenbrier&#146;s global growth complements and leverages our engineering expertise and production facilities in Mexico and Poland and at Gunderson, our flagship manufacturing facility in Oregon. Our
international activity extends the Greenbrier brand and provides business diversification and growth opportunities over the longer term.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furman concluded, &#147;Greenbrier will continue its balanced approach to investing in projects that generate high rates of return, seeking
growth opportunities in our core competencies, and returning capital to shareholders.&#148; </P>

before Interest and foreign exchange, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measurement tool commonly used by rail supply companies and Greenbrier. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or
as a substitute for other financial statement data determined in accordance with GAAP.&nbsp;In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, this measure presented
may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annualized ROIC is calculated by taking
year to date Earnings from operations, less cash paid for income taxes, net, which is then annualized and divided by the average balance of the sum of the Revolving notes, plus Notes payable, plus Total equity, less cash in excess of $40 million.
The average is calculated based on the quarterly ending balances. </P>

EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for other financial statement data determined in accordance with GAAP.&nbsp;In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations,

performance above target have been achieved. The second approach supplements the first by including the &#147;if converted&#148; effect of the 2018 Convertible notes issued in March 2011. Under the &#147;if converted method&#148; debt issuance and
interest costs, both net of tax, associated with the convertible notes are added back to net earnings and the share count is increased by the shares underlying the convertible notes. </P>
