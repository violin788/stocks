<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;30, 2011, (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (&#147;Greenbrier&#148;) entered into a Second Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (&#147;BofA&#148;), as Administrative Agent, Union Bank, National
Association (&#147;Union Bank&#148;), as Syndication Agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#038; Smith Incorporated, as Sole Lead
Arranger and Sole Book Manager, and the lenders identified therein (the &#147;Amended Credit Facility&#148;), which Amended
Credit Facility amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November&nbsp;7, 2006, as amended,
entered into by Greenbrier, BofA as the U.S. Administrative Agent, and the other parties thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amended Credit Facility allows Greenbrier to borrow, on a revolving basis, up to $245.0&nbsp;million at any time
outstanding, and matures on June&nbsp;30, 2016, at which time all amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amended Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Greenbrier and its material U.S.
Subsidiaries (the &#147;Subsidiary Guarantors&#148;), excluding the stock and assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and assets pledged as security for existing term loans. Greenbrier and the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into a Second
Amended and Restated Security Agreement and Second Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement under which each of Greenbrier
and the Subsidiary Guarantors granted the lenders security interests in the collateral securing their obligations under
the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Subsidiary Guarantors entered into a Second Amended and Restated Continuing
Guaranty under which they guaranteed the obligations of Greenbrier under the Amended Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Advances under the Amended Credit Facility are limited by a borrowing base formula consisting of a percentage of
eligible domestic assets including inventory, receivables, leased railcars and property, plant and equipment.
Outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the Applicable Rate
(as defined in the Amended Credit Facility), plus one of the following indexes: (i)&nbsp;BBA LIBOR and (ii)&nbsp;for
Dollar-denominated loans only, the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (a)&nbsp;the Bank of America &#147;prime rate&#148;, (b)
the Federal Funds rate plus .50% and (c)&nbsp;a daily rate equal to
one-month BBA LIBOR plus 1.0%).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amended Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including specified
restrictions on indebtedness, dispositions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, liens, fundamental
changes, sale and leaseback transactions and other restrictions. The Amended Credit Facility also requires Greenbrier
to comply with a Consolidated Adjusted Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) covenant and
a Consolidated Capitalization Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) covenant. It also contains customary
events of default, which include the occurrence of any Change of Control (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility).
If an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted in the Amended Credit Facility, the Administrative Agent
may terminate the commitments under the Amended Credit Facility, accelerate any outstanding loans under the Amended
Credit Facility and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lenders&#146; letter of credit exposure plus interest
thereon under the Amended Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The description of the Amended Credit Facility in this Current Report on Form 8-K is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the Amended Credit Facility, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 hereto and is
incorporated herein by reference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BofA, Union Bank, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#038; Smith Incorporated and certain of the other lenders under the Amended
Credit Facility have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking,
financial advisory, lending and/or commercial banking services, or other services for Greenbrier and is subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary
compensation and expense reimbursement.

1.02 and 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item&nbsp;1.01.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the entry into the Amended Credit Facility, Greenbrier repaid on June&nbsp;30, 2011 all outstanding
obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement, dated June&nbsp;10, 2009, among Greenbrier, WLR Recovery Fund&nbsp;IV, L.P.
and WLR IV Parallel ESC, L.P. as holders, the other holders party thereto, and WL Ross &#038; Co. LLC, as Administrative
Agent (the &#147;WLR Credit Agreement&#148;), thereby terminating its obligations thereunder. Immediately prior to its repayment
and termination, there were outstanding borrowings of $71.75&nbsp;million under the WLR Credit Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Two directors of Greenbrier, Mr.&nbsp;Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. and Ms.&nbsp;Wendy L. Teramoto, are affiliates of WL Ross &#038; Co. LLC and
another director of Greenbrier, Ms.&nbsp;Victoria McManus, is a holder of a portion of Greenbrier&#146;s debt under the WLR
Credit Agreement. Certain other material relationships between Greenbrier and the other parties to the WLR Credit
Agreement and/or their affiliates, including a warrant agreement, an investor rights and restrictions agreement, and a
railcar leasing portfolio transaction have been previously disclosed in Greenbrier&#146;s definitive proxy statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November&nbsp;24, 2010, which disclosures are incorporated herein by
reference. The payment of all amounts outstanding under the WLR Credit Agreement was approved by a majority of the
disinterested, independent members of Greenbrier&#146;s Board of Directors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the extent required by Item&nbsp;1.02 of Form 8-K, the information contained in (or incorporated by reference into) Items
1.01 and 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item&nbsp;1.02.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a
Registrant.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the entry into the Amended Credit Facility, on June&nbsp;30, 2011 borrowings by Greenbrier under the
Amended Credit Facility were approximately $75.0&nbsp;million and outstanding letters of credit were approximately $3.9
million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the extent required by Item&nbsp;2.03 of Form 8-K, the information contained in (or incorporated by reference into) Items
1.01 and 1.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item&nbsp;2.03.

and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in <U>Sections&nbsp;2.03(c)</U> and
<U>2.04(c)</U>, each Committed Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in
a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed
Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i)&nbsp;whether the Borrower is requesting a
Committed Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation
of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii)&nbsp;the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation,
as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii)&nbsp;the principal amount of Committed Loans
to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv)&nbsp;the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which
existing Committed Loans are to be converted, (v)&nbsp;if applicable, the duration of the Interest
Period with respect thereto, and (vi)&nbsp;the currency of the Committed Loans to be borrowed. If the
Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Committed Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, then the
Committed Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of
Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then
the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation
of Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as
Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one month. Any
automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest
Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such
Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified
an Interest Period of one month. No Committed Loan may be converted into or continued as a
Committed Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original
currency of such Committed Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
