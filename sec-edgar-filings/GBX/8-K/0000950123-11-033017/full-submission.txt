Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;30, 2011, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Greenbrier&#148;) entered into a
purchase agreement (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#038; Smith
Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs &#038; Co. (the &#147;Initial Purchasers&#148;). Pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, Greenbrier agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers $230&nbsp;million aggregate principal
amount of the Company&#146;s 3.5% Senior Convertible Notes due 2018 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;), which
amount includes $15&nbsp;million principal amount of Convertible Notes subject to the over-allotment
option granted to the Initial Purchasers. The over-allotment option was exercised in full on March
31, 2011, and the sale of $230&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes closed
on April&nbsp;5, 2011. The Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and conditions for agreements of
this type, including indemnification obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which
is filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the extent required by Item&nbsp;1.01 of Form 8-K, the information contained in (or incorporated by
reference into) Items 2.03 and 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by
reference into this Item&nbsp;1.01.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, on April
5, 2011, Greenbrier sold $230&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to the
Initial Purchasers and entered into an indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) with U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). The Indenture governs the Convertible Notes and contains
terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 3.5% payable in cash semi-annually in
arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October&nbsp;1, 2011. The Convertible
Notes mature on April&nbsp;1, 2018, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted in accordance
with their terms prior to such date. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of
Greenbrier&#146;s common stock as further described under Item&nbsp;3.02 below. No sinking fund is provided
for the Convertible Notes and Greenbrier may not redeem the Convertible Notes at its option. The
Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with
Greenbrier&#146;s other senior unsecured debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Indenture provides that if the Company undergoes certain types of fundamental changes prior to
the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, each Convertible Note holder has the option to require
the Company to repurchase all or any of such holder&#146;s Convertible Notes for cash. The fundamental
change repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change
repurchase date all as provided for in the Indenture.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Indenture further provides for customary events of default, which include: (i)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s
failure to pay when due the principal of any of the Convertible Notes at its stated maturity, upon
exercise of a repurchase right or otherwise; (ii)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s failure to pay an installment of
interest on any of the Convertible Notes for 30&nbsp;days or more after the date when due; (iii)&nbsp;the
Company&#146;s failure to deliver shares of common stock, together with cash instead of fractional
shares, when those shares and cash instead of fractional shares are required to be delivered or
paid, as the case may be, following conversion

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of a Convertible Note, and such failure continues for a period of five business days; (iv)&nbsp;the
Company&#146;s failure to provide a &#147;Fundamental Change Company Notice&#148; as required by the Indenture;
(v)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s failure to comply with its obligations in the event of certain consolidations,
mergers, sales of assets and other transactions; (vi)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s failure to perform or observe
any other term, covenant or agreement contained in the Convertible Notes or the Indenture for a
period of 60&nbsp;days after written notice of such failure, requiring the Company to remedy the same,
shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the
holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Convertible Notes;
(vii)&nbsp;a default by the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to any mortgage, agreement
or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or
evidenced, any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $50.0&nbsp;million in the aggregate, which
default (a)&nbsp;results in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable or (b)
constitutes a failure to pay the principal or interest of any such debt when due and payable at its
stated maturity, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; <I>provided,
however</I>, that, if such default ceases or is cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then an event of
default described in this clause (vii)&nbsp;shall be deemed to be no longer continuing; and (viii)
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company or any
significant subsidiary (or any group of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries that, taken together, would
constitute a significant subsidiary). If an event of default described in sub-clause (viii)&nbsp;above
occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, then principal of all of the Convertible Notes and
the interest thereon shall automatically become immediately due and payable. If an event of default
described in sub-clauses (i)&nbsp;through (vii)&nbsp;above occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
holders, with written notice to the Trustee, of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Convertible Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of, and accrued interest on, all the
Convertible Notes due and payable. Such declaration may be rescinded and annulled with the written
consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then
outstanding, subject to the provisions of the Indenture.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Greenbrier intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes, together with
additional cash on hand, to finance its previously announced tender offer (the &#147;Tender Offer&#148;),
which Greenbrier launched on March&nbsp;30, 2011, to repurchase any and all of its outstanding $235
million aggregate principal amount of its 8<FONT style="FONT-size: 70%"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>/<FONT style="FONT-size: 60%">8</FONT>
% senior notes due 2015 (the &#147;2015 Notes&#148;), and to
redeem any and all of the 2015 Notes that remain outstanding following the consummation or other
termination of the Tender Offer.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Convertible Notes were offered in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in
accordance with Rule&nbsp;144A in reliance on a private placement exemption from registration afforded
by Section&nbsp;4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). The
Convertible Notes and the common stock issuable upon their conversion may be offered and resold
only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and other
applicable securities laws. The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the
Convertible Notes were approximately $222.1&nbsp;million, after deducting estimated fees and expenses,
including the Initial Purchasers discount of $6.9&nbsp;million.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes at their option at any time
prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the stated maturity date.
The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock at an initial
conversion rate of 26.2838 shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.05 per
share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain events, such as
distributions, dividends or stock splits. At the initial conversion rate, assuming the conversion
of all $230&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes
may be converted into approximately 6,045,274 shares of the Greenbrier&#146;s common stock, which number
is subject to adjustment as provided for in the Indenture.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If Greenbrier undergoes certain types of make-whole fundamental changes on or before April&nbsp;1, 2018,
then in certain circumstances the Company will pay a fundamental change make-whole premium on the
Convertible Notes converted in connection with such make-whole fundamental change by increasing the
conversion rate on such Convertible Notes. The amount of the fundamental change make-whole premium,
if any, will be based on the Company&#146;s common stock price and the effective date of the make-whole
fundamental change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Greenbrier will not file a registration statement for the resale of the Convertible Notes or the
shares of common stock issuable upon their conversion. If, at any time during the six-month period
beginning on, and including, the date that is six months after the last date of original issuance
of the Convertible Notes and ending on the date that is one year after the last date of original
issuance of the Convertible Notes, either (i)&nbsp;Greenbrier fails to timely file any periodic report
that it is required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section&nbsp;13 or 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as applicable (after giving effect to all
applicable grace periods thereunder and other than reports on Form 8-K), or (ii)&nbsp;the Convertible
Notes are not otherwise freely tradable pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act by holders
other than Greenbrier&#146;s affiliates, or under the terms of the Indenture or the Convertible Notes,
then in either case (an &#147;additional interest event&#148;), Greenbrier will pay additional interest on
the Convertible Notes. Additional interest will accrue on the Convertible Notes at the rate of
0.25% per annum of the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding for each day during the
first 90-day period (or portion thereof) for which an additional interest event has occurred and is
continuing, which rate will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of
the Convertible Notes outstanding, up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum of the principal amount of
the Convertible Notes outstanding, for each day thereafter for which an additional interest event
has occurred and is continuing. Further, if, and for so long as, the restrictive legend on the
Convertible Notes has not been removed or the Convertible Notes are not otherwise freely tradable
pursuant to Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act by holders other than Greenbrier&#146;s affiliates as of
the 365th day after the last date of original issuance of the Convertible Notes, then Greenbrier
will be obligated to pay additional interest on the Convertible Notes at the rate of 0.50% per
annum of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes outstanding for each day until the
Convertible Notes are freely tradable as described above.

other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one

pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total
net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses)

and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>Greenbrier announces pricing and increased size of offering of Convertible Senior
Notes due 2018</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Lake Oswego, Oregon, March&nbsp;31, 2011 </B>&#151; The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.
&#091;NYSE:GBX&#093; announced today that it has increased the size of its previously announced
offering of $200&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the
&#147;Notes&#148;) to $215&nbsp;million. The Notes are being offered in the United States only to qualified
institutional buyers in accordance with Rule&nbsp;144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). Greenbrier has also granted the initial purchasers a 30-day over-allotment
option to purchase up to an additional $15&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of Notes on the same
terms and conditions. Greenbrier expects to close the offering of the Notes on or about April&nbsp;5,
2011, subject to satisfaction of various customary closing conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 3.5% payable semiannually in arrears in
cash on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October&nbsp;1, 2011. The Notes will be
convertible into shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock, based on an initial conversion rate of
26.2838 shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is
equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.05 per share of common stock. This
represents a premium of 37.5% above the last reported sale price of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March&nbsp;30, 2011 (which was $27.67 per share). The
conversion rate and conversion price are subject to adjustment in certain events, such as
distributions, dividends or stock splits. The Notes will mature on April&nbsp;1, 2018, unless earlier
repurchased by us or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes will
be senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of the Company&#146;s existing and
future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of its existing and future subordinated debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenbrier intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with additional cash on
hand, to (i)&nbsp;purchase any and all of Greenbrier&#146;s outstanding $235&nbsp;million aggregate principal
amount of its 8 3/8% senior notes due 2015 (the &#147;2015 Notes&#148;) that are tendered pursuant to a cash
tender offer and consent solicitation which Greenbrier announced on March&nbsp;30, 2011, (ii)&nbsp;pay the
consent and other fees in connection with such cash tender offer and consent solicitation and (iii)
redeem or otherwise retire any and all 2015 Notes that remain outstanding following consummation of
the cash tender offer.
