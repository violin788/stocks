</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;6, 2010, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (&#147;Greenbrier&#148;) entered into a purchase
agreement (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) by and among Greenbrier and the underwriters named therein
(the &#147;Underwriters&#148;). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Greenbrier agreed to sell and the
Underwriters agreed to purchase for resale to the public (the &#147;Public Offering&#148;), subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, 4,000,000 shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock at a price of
$12.50 to the public, less an underwriting discount of $0.625 per share. The Underwriters also
have an option to purchase up to 600,000 additional shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock at the same
price per share solely to cover over-allotments, if any. The Public Offering is expected to close
on May&nbsp;12, 2010, subject to customary closing conditions. The foregoing description of the
Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;1.1 and is
incorporated herein by reference.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common stock to be sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement was registered pursuant to
Greenbrier&#146;s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No.&nbsp;333-165924) (the
&#147;Registration Statement&#148;). In connection with Greenbrier filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a prospectus supplement dated May&nbsp;6, 2010, Greenbrier is filing as Exhibits 5.1 and 23.1
hereto, and to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, an opinion and consent
of Tonkon Torp LLP, legal counsel to Greenbrier, issued to Greenbrier as to the validity of the
shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock being offered in the Public Offering. The Purchase Agreement
is also incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.

respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party
shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not
materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties
indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by
the Representatives and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel
to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate
at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the
indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to
the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses
of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in

contemplated by Section&nbsp;6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i)&nbsp;such settlement is
entered into more than 45&nbsp;days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request,
(ii)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30
