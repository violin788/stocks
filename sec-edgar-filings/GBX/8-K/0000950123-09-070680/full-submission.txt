<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Greenbrier modifies long-term new railcar contract with GE Railcar Services</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Oswego, OR, December&nbsp;15, 2009 &#151; The Greenbrier Companies &#091;NYSE:GBX&#093; today announced an
agreement with General Electric Railcar Services Corporation (&#147;GER&#148;), a subsidiary of GE Capital,
GE&#146;s financial services business, to modify GER&#146;s new railcar manufacturing contract with
Greenbrier. Under the terms of the original 2007 contract, the Company was to manufacture 11,900
new tank cars and hopper cars for GER over an eight-year period, of which the last 8,500 units
would be delivered subject to Greenbrier&#146;s fulfillment of certain contractual conditions. As
scheduled, deliveries to GER commenced in December&nbsp;2008 and to date approximately 600 railcars have
been delivered and accepted under the original contract.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the modified contract, the parties have agreed to reduce the contract
quantities to up to 6,000 railcars. Greenbrier will build the first 3,800 tank cars and hopper cars
by July&nbsp;2013. The delivery and purchase price of these units
is agreed upon, with the purchase price subject to
adjustments for changes in the Company&#146;s material costs. The blended purchase price on these 3,800
units represents a price increase from the original contract, and delivery of these units has been
extended by 27&nbsp;months from the original contract. The remaining 2,200 tank and hopper cars are
subject to fulfillment of certain contractual conditions by both parties in their sole discretion
and would occur over the next five-year period. In addition, Greenbrier has retained the right of
first refusal, subject to certain qualifications, to manufacture all new railcar builds for GER
through December&nbsp;2018.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modified deal contains many other additional benefits to both Greenbrier and GER.
Greenbrier will become a Preferred Railcar Maintenance Provider for GER&#146;s fleet of railcars and
will perform railcar maintenance and refurbishment work for GER under a new five-year agreement
with a minimum contract value of approximately $25&nbsp;million. Under this contract, Greenbrier will,
in the first calendar quarter of 2010, begin to cut-down 485 double-stack intermodal platforms from
48&#146; in length to 40&#146; in length at the Company&#146;s Gunderson facility in Portland, Oregon. In certain
situations, Greenbrier has also obtained a right of first refusal, subject to certain
qualifications, to perform railcar refurbishment and program work through March&nbsp;7, 2015.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the modified contract, Greenbrier&#146;s total firm new railcar manufacturing
backlog as of November&nbsp;30, 2009 is 4,900 units valued at
approximately $430&nbsp;million. This backlog
figure excludes the contingent production of 2,200 units for GER.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on current production plans, including those for GER under the revised agreement,
approximately 2,000 units in backlog are scheduled for delivery in Greenbrier&#146;s fiscal year ending

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">August&nbsp;31, 2010. The Company delivered approximately 350 new railcar units during its first
fiscal quarter ended November&nbsp;30, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William A. Furman, president and chief executive officer of Greenbrier, said, &#147;We are pleased
to have reached an agreement that is responsive to our customer&#146;s business needs while also
delivering value to our shareholders, creating security for our North American workforce and adding
visibility throughout the rail industry supply chain. By stretching out new railcar production
schedules, we have stabilized our production at current levels or higher for at least the next two
years. The excellent quality of our new railcar work and broad geographic reach of our repair and
refurbishment network were key factors that gave us the ability to successfully conclude this
contract modification with GE Railcar. This favorable outcome demonstrates the value of our
integrated business model. In addition, through our rights of first refusal, we will be able to
participate in opportunities with GE Railcar as the economy recovers.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furman went on to say, &#147;While the modified terms of the contract do not materially change the
Company&#146;s previously-stated business outlook for the 2010 fiscal year, it resolves significant
uncertainty within our manufacturing segment and improves the outlook and visibility of our
refurbishment &#038; parts segment. With the contract modification, we estimate Greenbrier currently
possesses about 40% of total new railcar industry backlog in North America. Given the current
environment, we believe this outcome is not only favorable to Greenbrier, but also to the overall
new railcar supply industry in North America.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furman concluded, &#147;Together with GE, we were able to work out a win-win solution to the
difficult position faced by both parties in the present economy. On behalf of our workforce in
North America, and the many jobs at stake in the railcar supply
industry, we acknowledge and
appreciate GE Railcar&#146;s willingness to stand by its commitment and help maintain family-wage
manufacturing jobs in North America.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Lattanzio, president and chief executive officer of GE Railcar Services, stated, &#147;The
modified contract, which recognizes the harsh realities of the economic environment, delivers
tangible benefits for both companies, enabling us to continue to meet our customers&#146; needs. We are
pleased that today&#146;s agreements allow us to look forward and build on our long-standing business
relationship with Greenbrier. Also, we thank the Greenbrier team for working with us and
maintaining their strong quality standards throughout this process.&#148;
