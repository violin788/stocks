performance-based vesting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time-based shares will vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period beginning on
the first anniversary following the date of the grant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance-based shares will vest, in whole or in part, contingent upon achievement of the
Company&#146;s goals relating to adjusted EBITDA and working capital during the applicable measurement
periods, described below. The performance goals are weighted, with vesting of 70% of the
performance-based shares being dependent upon performance against the adjusted EBITDA criteria,
measured during the period March&nbsp;1, 2011 &#151; August&nbsp;31, 2013, and vesting of 30% of the
performance-based shares being dependent upon performance against the working capital goal,
measured during fiscal 2013. Vesting of shares related to each performance goal will be
considered independently. Threshold, target and stretch performance levels are established for
each of the adjusted EBITDA and working capital goals. If the Company achieves the threshold level
of performance on a goal (which is 90% of the target level goal), then 50% of the performance-based
shares tied to that goal will vest (<I>e.g.</I>, 35% of the performance-based shares, if threshold
performance is achieved for the adjusted EBITDA goal, and 15% of the performance-based shares if
threshold performance is achieved for the working capital goal). If the Company achieves the
target level of performance on a goal, 100% of the performance-based shares tied to that goal will
vest. Stretch goals also have been established at 125% of the adjusted EBITDA and working capital
goals. If the Company achieves a stretch goal, then as soon as administratively practicable
following the end of the relevant performance period, the Company will grant an additional stock
award to each participant in a number of shares equal to 100% of the number of performance-based
shares awarded to the participant on May&nbsp;25, 2011 with respect to such goal, which additional
shares will be fully vested when issued. Restricted stock vesting will be interpolated for
performance between threshold and target, and any award of additional shares will be interpolated
for performance between target and stretch goals.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Restoration of Salaries and Salary Increases</U></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously reported on Forms 8-K filed on February&nbsp;11, 2009 and November&nbsp;16, 2010, on March
1, 2009 the Company implemented salary reductions ranging from 7.5% to 12.5% of annual base
compensation for its executive officers, depending on their annual compensation range, and a 50%
reduction in the annual base compensation of the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, William A.
Furman, in response to economic conditions then existing. Effective December&nbsp;1, 2010 the Company
partially restored the salary reductions, restoring 50% of the reductions for its executive
officers other than Mr.&nbsp;Furman, and restoring 3.5% of Mr.&nbsp;Furman&#146;s annual base compensation. Also
effective December&nbsp;1, 2010, Alejandro Centurion and certain other executive officers received
salary increases beyond the partial restoration of annual base compensation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;25, 2011 the Compensation Committee approved the full restoration of annual base
compensation for all executive officers, effective July&nbsp;1, 2011 and subject to the Company
achieving profitability (adjusted for unusual and non-recurring items, in the discretion of the
Compensation Committee) in the third fiscal quarter of 2011 and an outlook of sustained
profitability, including the full restoration of Mr.&nbsp;Furman&#146;s annual base compensation to $750,000.
The Compensation Committee also approved certain market-based annual base salary increases to
executive officers other than Mr.&nbsp;Furman, effective July&nbsp;1, 2011 and subject to achieving
profitability as described above, including an increase in Mr.&nbsp;Glenn&#146;s base salary to $275,000, an
increase in Mr.&nbsp;Rittenbaum&#146;s base salary to $375,000; and an increase Mr.&nbsp;Stuckey&#146;s base salary to
$275,000. The Committee authorized and directed the Company to prepare and execute amendments to
the employment agreements between the Company and each of Messrs.&nbsp;Furman, Rittenbaum and Stuckey to
reflect such salary increases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to fully restore base salaries for all employees to levels in place prior
to the reductions made effective March&nbsp;1, 2009, effective July&nbsp;1, 2011 and subject to achieving
profitability as described above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Bonus Program</U></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;25, 2011 the Compensation Committee also adopted and approved a performance-based bonus
program, pursuant to which certain of the Company&#146;s employees may earn formula-based bonuses based
on the Company&#146;s performance measured against its adjusted EBITDA and working capital goals, and
achievement of individual performance goals. The bonus program will be implemented for the 2011
fiscal year, measuring performance from March&nbsp;1, 2011 through August&nbsp;31, 2011. A total available
bonus pool for fiscal year 2011 will be established that consists of two components: An EBITDA
pool and a working capital pool. If a specified threshold level of adjusted EBITDA performance is
achieved, the size of the EBITDA pool can range from 1.5% up to 4.0% of total adjusted EBITDA,
depending upon the Company&#146;s performance against the adjusted EBITDA goals. If a specified
threshold level of performance of the working capital goal is achieved, the working capital pool
can range from $600,000 to $1.3&nbsp;million, depending upon the Company&#146;s performance against the
working capital goal. If adjusted EBITDA is less than the specified threshold level of
performance, there

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">will be no EBITDA pool or working capital pool, but a default bonus pool of between $750,000 to $1
million will be established to reward outstanding individual performance against specific goals and
as a retention incentive. The amount of bonus awards from such default bonus pool would be
determined in the discretion of William A. Furman, the Company&#146;s President and Chief Executive
Officer, provided that any awards to be made to executive officers of the Company would be subject
to approval by the Compensation Committee.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual payout of the available bonus pool is tied to individual performance against
specific goals. As part of the bonus program, the Compensation Committee adopted and approved
individual performance goals and maximum bonus amounts, as a percentage of the base salary (after
full restoration of reductions implemented on March&nbsp;1, 2009 and adjustments previously approved for
certain individuals, but not including any base salary increases described above), for each of the
Company&#146;s executive officers, including its named executive officers. The maximum bonus Mr.&nbsp;Furman
can earn under the bonus program, based on achievement of all stretch goals for the Company and
100% of individual goals, is equal to 60% of his base salary; the maximum bonus Mr.&nbsp;Centurion can
earn is equal to 35% of his base salary; the maximum bonus Mr.&nbsp;Glenn can earn is equal to 45% of
his base salary; the maximum bonus Mr.&nbsp;Rittenbaum can earn is equal to 45% of his base salary; and
the maximum bonus Mr.&nbsp;Stuckey can earn is equal to 30% of his base salary. Mr.&nbsp;Furman&#146;s individual
goals relate to leasing operations, corporate efficiency, staffing and succession planning. Mr.
Centurion&#146;s individual goals relate to the Company&#146;s overall North American manufacturing
operations, the successful production line start-up and/or capacity expansion of certain of those
operations, and safety and quality matters. Mr.&nbsp;Glenn&#146;s individual goals relate to financing for
leasing operations, product development, railcar orders and other new customer contracts. Mr.
Rittenbaum&#146;s individual goals relate to certain financings, corporate efficiencies, financial
planning, compensation plans, staffing and succession planning. Mr.&nbsp;Stuckey&#146;s individual goals
relate to Greenbrier Rail Services operations, safety, succession planning, and new customer
contracts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and individual performance goals established for the bonus program for Mr.&nbsp;Furman
replace the performance-based bonus program set forth in his current employment agreement with the
Company. The Compensation Committee approved in principle the amendment of Mr.&nbsp;Furman&#146;s Employment
Agreement to reflect that change.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Amendment of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan</U></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;25, 2011 the Compensation Committee approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan to permit participants in the Plan to elect to defer receipt of
restricted stock and other stock-based awards made pursuant to the Company&#146;s 2010 Amended and
Restated Stock Incentive Plan.
