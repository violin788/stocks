<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>Greenbrier Announces New Railcar and Refurbishment Orders</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>~
Total orders valued at approximately $130&nbsp;million ~<BR>
~ Plans to reduce production of marine barges with uncertain outlook ~<BR>
~ Company to add 260 workers at its Gunderson facility ~</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Lake Oswego, Oregon, August&nbsp;25, 2010 &#150; </B>The Greenbrier Companies &#091;NYSE:GBX&#093; announced today
that it has received orders for over 1,000 new double-stack intermodal platforms, along with orders
for over 700 new covered hopper cars. In addition, Greenbrier will re-engineer and modify
approximately 1,100 existing double-stack platforms to 53&#146; from smaller dimensions. The aggregate
value of the new railcar orders and refurbishment work is approximately $130&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new double-stack railcar orders and refurbishment work will be carried out at the Company&#146;s Gunderson
and Greenbrier Rail Services facilities in calendar 2010 and 2011. The orders are from five
separate customers, and are subject to final documentation, but are considered to be firm
commitments. The customers, who were not disclosed, represent major railroad and leasing companies
in North America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support these orders, Greenbrier will increase its workforce by 260 workers at its Gunderson facility in Portland, Oregon,
 bringing total employment to over 900 employees.
These additions will be carried out by  calling back workers previously furloughed during the
industry downturn or by new hires. Also, the Company will divert approximately 175 workers from
its ocean-going marine barge construction at Gunderson to new railcar
production in support of the new orders, and as a
result of current softness in the marine market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new and refurbished railcars will support a growing need for 53&#146; double-stack well
capacity in North America, despite a continued surplus of 40&#146; and 48&#146; equipment. Double-stack
freight cars transport various sizes of containers stacked two high. The majority of such
railcars are constructed to haul 40&#146; international ocean-going containers. The recent strong
growth in 53&#146; domestic containerization allows railroad shippers to compete effectively

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">with longer and heavier
trucks on the nation&#146;s highways. Greenbrier is adjusting its production to fulfill this growing
demand.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is in discussions
with its largest marine customer about contracts in backlog due to
an industry-wide slowdown in marine demand. This customer represents over 85% of the Company&#146;s
marine backlog &#151;  approximately $75&nbsp;million as of May&nbsp;31, 2010. These discussions may result in
cancellation, modification or postponement of the orders. Such an event is likely to occur, and any
compensation or alternative production the Company receives may not be adequate to replace the lost
revenue and margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed, in May&nbsp;2010 the Company slowed its marine production rates, and has
reduced those rates further during the current fiscal quarter. Beginning in the Company&#146;s
first fiscal quarter of 2011, marine production rates will be reduced again due to the
greater need for a rail workforce, uncertainty surrounding production of the current backlog, overall softness in the marine
market and continued concern about the City of Portland&#146;s River Plan, which Greenbrier believes is
a long-term threat to marine jobs on the Portland waterfront. Greenbrier anticipates that revenues
and margin from its marine operations will be lower in its fourth fiscal quarter than in previous
fiscal 2010 quarters, and that fiscal 2011 marine revenues and margin will be lower than 2010
revenues and margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenbrier president and CEO, William A. Furman said, &#147;The recent orders for double-stack
equipment represent the early signs of a restoration in demand for this car type. Greenbrier has
built over 80,000 double-stack platforms, more than 60% of all double-stack platforms ever built in North America, and has modified over 3,000
double-stack platforms  over the past four years. We believe that our superior designs
and engineering reduce the life cycle cost of this equipment for our customers and provides a
better, more reliable and safer transportation vehicle for service with customers in the North
American markets. Year-over-year growth in North American intermodal container traffic, a key
indicator of Greenbrier&#146;s new railcar outlook, has been 16.8%. Intermodal loadings have outpaced
the 10.1% increase in overall rail traffic, as intermodal recovers significantly from its 2009
levels. We continue to see requests for proposals for new 53&#146; double-stack cars from other major
customers, and demand for this product continues to build momentum into 2011.&#148; Furman continued,
&#147;These recent developments show the value of our flexible workforce and the importance of our
diversification efforts in recent years. Our integrated business model is creating value for our
customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In the current environment, we were able to
 adjust resources quickly across multiple disciplines.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For example, we were able to divert
experienced marine labor  when faced with uncertainties in marine demand to support new rail demand. Finally, the
combination of our leasing and refurbishment businesses allowed us to address the need for
immediate delivery of a specific car type and enabled us to respond quickly and decisively.&#148;

indebtedness; write-downs of goodwill in future periods; sufficient availability of borrowing
capacity; fluctuations in demand for newly manufactured railcars or failure to obtain orders as
anticipated in developing forecasts; loss of one or more significant customers; customer payment
defaults or related issues; actual future costs and the availability of materials and a trained
workforce; failure to design or manufacture new products or technologies or to achieve
certification or market acceptance of new products or technologies; steel price fluctuations and
scrap surcharges; changes in product mix and the mix between segments; labor disputes, energy
shortages or operating difficulties that might disrupt manufacturing operations or the flow of
cargo; production difficulties and product delivery delays as a result of, among other matters,
changing technologies or non-performance of subcontractors or suppliers; ability to obtain suitable
contracts for the sale of leased equipment and risks related to car hire and residual values;
difficulties associated with governmental regulation, including environmental liabilities;
integration of current or future acquisitions; succession planning; all as may be discussed in more
detail under the headings &#147;Risk Factors&#148; and &#147;Forward Looking Statements&#148; in our Annual Report on
