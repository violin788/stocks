converted&#148; effect of the 2018 Notes issued in March 2011. Under the &#147;if converted&#148; method, debt issuance and interest costs, both net of tax, associated with the convertible notes are added back to net earnings and the share count is
increased by the shares underlying the convertible notes. The 2026 convertible notes are included in the calculation of both approaches using the treasury stock method when the average stock price is greater than the applicable conversion price.

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2015-03).</FONT> The FASB issued this update to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to present the debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value
of the debt liability rather than showing the debt issuance costs as an asset. As the adoption of this new guidance only amended presentation and disclosure requirements and did not impact its recognition and measurement, the adoption did not affect
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The debt issuance costs which were reclassified from assets to net against notes payable for the fiscal years ended August&nbsp;31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 were $2.1 million and

restructuring charges, gain on contribution to joint venture, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense and interest and foreign exchange. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measurement tool commonly used by rail supply companies and us. You
should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for other financial statement data determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible
to varying calculations, this measure presented may differ from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. This <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-GAAP</FONT> financial measure has limitations as an
analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net earnings, cash flow, earnings per share or other consolidated statements of operation or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these
limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or reduce indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Greenbrier hereby discloses the following risks about its business: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to Our Business </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>During economic
downturns or a rising interest rate environment, the cyclical nature of our business results in lower demand for our products and services and reduced revenue. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business is cyclical. Overall economic conditions and the purchasing practices of buyers have a significant effect upon our business due to
the impact on demand for our products and services. As a result, during downturns, we could operate with a lower level of backlog and may slow down or halt production at some or all of our facilities. Economic conditions that result in higher
interest rates increase the cost of new leasing arrangements, which could cause some of our leasing customers to lease fewer of our railcars or demand shorter lease terms. An economic downturn or increase in interest rates may reduce demand for our
products and services, resulting in lower sales volumes, lower prices, lower lease utilization rates and decreased profits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently,
interest rates remain at historically low levels. Higher interest rates could increase the cost of, or potentially deter, new leasing arrangements with our customers, reduce our ability to syndicate railcars under lease to financial institutions, or
impact the sales price we may receive on such syndications, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>A change in our product mix due to shifts in demand could have an adverse effect on our profitability. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We manufacture and, through GBW, repair a variety of railcars. The demand for specific types of these railcars and mix of refurbishment work
varies from time to time. These shifts in demand could affect our revenue and margins and could have an adverse effect on our profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>A
prolonged decline in performance of the rail freight industry would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our future success depends in part upon the performance of the rail freight industry, which in turn depends on the health of the economy. If
railcar loadings, railcar and railcar components replacement rates or refurbishment rates or industry demand for our railcar products weaken or otherwise do not materialize, if railcar transportation becomes more efficient from an increase in
velocity or a decrease in dwell times, or if the rail freight industry becomes oversupplied, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our manufacturing backlog represents future production for which we have written orders from our customers in various periods, and estimated
potential revenue attributable to those orders. Some of this backlog is subject to certain conditions, including potential adjustment to prices due to changes in prevailing market prices, or due to lower prices for new orders accepted by us from
other customers for similar cars on similar terms and conditions during relevant time periods. Our reported backlog may not be converted to revenue in any particular period and some of our contracts permit cancellations with limited compensation
that would not replace lost revenue or margins. In addition, some customers may attempt to cancel or modify a contract even if the contract does not allow for such cancellation or modification, and we may not be able to recover all revenue or
earnings lost due to a breach of contract. The likelihood of attempted cancellations or modifications of contracts generally increases during periods of market weakness. Actual revenue from such contracts may not equal our anticipated revenues based
on our backlog, and therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A portion of our backlog
and Leased railcars for syndication relates to the energy sector. A decline in energy prices could negatively impact the creditworthiness of our customers, lead to attempted modifications or cancellations of contracts or negatively impact our
ability to syndicate our railcars, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our backlog as of November&nbsp;30, 2016 </P>

includes an aggregate of 3,800 covered hopper railcars for use in energy related sand transportation, of which 2,500 units, scheduled for production in 2018, are for a customer who is negotiating
with us to modify the order. We cannot guarantee our other customers will not seek to cancel, settle or modify their orders or that our reported railcar backlog will convert to revenue in any particular period, if at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We derive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, the loss of or reduction of business from one or more of which could
have an adverse effect on our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant portion of our revenue is generated from a few major customers. Although we
have some long-term contractual relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to use our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. A reduction in the purchase or
leasing of our products or a termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We could be unable to lease railcars at satisfactory rates, remarket leased railcars on favorable terms upon lease termination or realize the expected
residual values upon lease termination, which could reduce our revenue and decrease our overall return or effect our ability to sell leased assets in the future. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The profitability of our railcar leasing business depends on our ability to lease railcars to our customers at satisfactory rates, and to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-market</FONT> or sell railcars we own or manage upon the expiration of existing lease terms. The total rental payments we receive under our operating leases do not fully amortize the acquisition costs of the leased
equipment, which exposes us to risks associated with remarketing the railcars. Our ability to lease or remarket leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, market and industry conditions, cost of and
demand for competing used or newer models, costs associated with the refurbishment of the railcars, market demand or governmental mandate for refurbishment, and interest rates. A downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased
demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-marketing</FONT> risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms, requiring us to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-market</FONT> leased railcars more
frequently. Furthermore, the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers. From&nbsp;November 30, 2014 to&nbsp;November 30, 2016, the percentage of railcars in the fleet on lease has declined from
approximately&nbsp;98% to&nbsp;94%. Our inability to lease, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-market</FONT> or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in reduced revenues and margins or net gain on disposition of equipment and
decrease our overall returns and affect our ability to syndicate railcars to investors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Risks related to our operations outside of the
U.S.&nbsp;could adversely affect our operating results. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current operations outside of the U.S.&nbsp;and any future expansion
of our international operations are subject to the risks associated with cross-border business transactions and activities. Political, legal, trade, financial market or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our foreign business
activities and operations. Some foreign countries in which we operate or may operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety, railcar design and railcar component part design, performance and manufacturing. If we fail to obtain and
maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate or may operate, we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries. In addition, unexpected changes in regulatory
requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment, adverse tax consequences and currency and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our
products difficult. The uncertainty of the legal environment or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">geo-political</FONT> risks in these and other areas could limit our ability to enforce our rights effectively. Because we have operations outside the
U.S., we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S.&nbsp;Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in
certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties and fines. Any
international expansion or acquisition that we undertake could amplify these risks related to operating outside of the U.S. </P>

the EPA estimates will take 13 years of active remediation, followed by more than 20 years of monitoring, all at a net present value of $1.05&nbsp;billion. The EPA expects its cost estimates to be within a range of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">-30%</FONT> to +50%. However, the EPA has acknowledged that more data needs to be collected before a remedy can be designed and that costs may change significantly based upon that additional data. The EPA&#146;s ROD

significant problem with an implementation, integration with other systems or ongoing management and operation of our systems could negatively impact our business by disrupting operations. Such a problem could also have an adverse effect on our

secrets to protect our intellectual property. However, these protections might be inadequate. Our pending or future trademark, copyright and patent applications might not be approved or, if allowed, might not be sufficiently broad. If our
intellectual property rights are not adequately protected we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market
share and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, third parties might assert that our products, services, or other business activities infringe their patents or other intellectual
property rights. Infringement and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert
our management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to cease selling or using products that incorporate the asserted intellectual
property, which would adversely affect our revenues, pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property or pay substantial fees to obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not
be available on reasonable terms, if at all. In the event of an adverse determination in an intellectual property suit or proceeding, or our failure to license essential technology or redesign our products so as not to infringe third party
intellectual property rights, our sales could be harmed and our costs could increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In response to an emerging scientific and political consensus, legislation and new rules to regulate emission of GHGs has been introduced in
numerous state legislatures, the U.S.&nbsp;Congress, and by the EPA. Some of these proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that may require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. While we cannot assess the direct
impact of these or other potential regulations, we recognize that new climate change protocols could affect the demand for our products and/or affect the price of materials, input factors and manufactured components which could impact our margins.
Potential opportunities could include greater demand for certain types of railcars, while potential challenges could include decreased demand for certain types of railcars or other products and higher energy costs. Other adverse consequences of
climate change could include an increased frequency of severe weather events and rising sea levels that could affect operations at our manufacturing facilities, the price of insuring company assets, or other unforeseen disruptions of our operations,

to interest expense in the next 12 months. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of November&nbsp;30, 2016, our Mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture had
$0.7&nbsp;million of third party debt, of which we and our joint venture partner have each guaranteed approximately $0.3&nbsp;million. In accordance with customary business practices in Europe, we have $2.1&nbsp;million in third party warranty
guarantee facilities as of November&nbsp;30, 2016. To date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantee facilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We made
$0.6&nbsp;million in cash contributions to GBW, an unconsolidated 50/50 joint venture, for the three months ended November&nbsp;30, 2016 which represented a reinvestment of a distribution received from GBW during the quarter. We expect to make
additional cash contributions to GBW of approximately $1.9&nbsp;million during 2017, which represent reinvestments of additional distributions we expect to receive from GBW during the year. We are likely to make additional capital contributions or
loans to GBW in the future. As of November&nbsp;30, 2016, we had a $36.5&nbsp;million note receivable balance from GBW which is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable, net. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2016, we entered into an agreement with Astra Rail Management GmbH (Astra) to form a new company, Greenbrier-Astra Rail, which is
expected to create an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-to-end,</FONT></FONT> Europe-based freight railcar manufacturing, engineering and repair business. The combined enterprise will be formed between our
European operations headquartered in Swidnica, Poland and Astra based in Arad, Romania. It is expected that the combined enterprise will be led by an experienced Europe-based management team from both companies and will offer manufacturing and
service capability in Europe. Assuming the transaction closes, Greenbrier-Astra Rail will be controlled by us with an approximate 75% interest. As partial consideration for our majority interest, we will pay Astra &#128;&nbsp;30&nbsp;million at
closing and &#128;&nbsp;30&nbsp;million 12 months after closing. We will provide a guarantee in connection with the &#128;&nbsp;30&nbsp;million to be paid to Astra 12 months after the closing. Closing of the transaction is contingent on, among other
conditions, achieving antitrust approval in certain EU countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, we are involved as a defendant in litigation in the
ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with certainty. Recently, we received an adverse judgment of approximately $15&nbsp;million on one matter related to commercial litigation in a foreign jurisdiction. We intend to
vigorously contest the judgment on appeal. While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be determined at this time, we believe that the resolution of this pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. Upon conversion,
the Notes may be settled, at Greenbrier&#146;s election, in shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares. Interest on the Notes is expected to be payable semiannually in arrears. The Notes will be
Greenbrier&#146;s senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior to all of its existing and future subordinated debt. </P>

release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. </P>
