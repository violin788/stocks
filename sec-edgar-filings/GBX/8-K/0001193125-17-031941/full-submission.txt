<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;31, 2017, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Greenbrier&#148;) entered into a purchase agreement (the
&#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp; Co. as representatives of the initial purchasers listed in the Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Initial Purchasers&#148;).
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Greenbrier agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers $275&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of the Company&#146;s&nbsp;2.875% Senior Convertible Notes due&nbsp;2024 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;), which
amount includes $25&nbsp;million principal amount of Convertible Notes subject to the option granted to the Initial Purchasers to purchase additional notes. The option was exercised in full on February&nbsp;1, 2017, and the sale of $275&nbsp;million
aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes closed on February&nbsp;6, 2017. The Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and conditions for agreements of this type, including indemnification obligations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent required by
Item&nbsp;1.01 of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;8-K,</FONT> the information contained in (or incorporated by reference into) Items&nbsp;2.03 and&nbsp;3.02 of this Current Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;8-K</FONT>

the Purchase Agreement, on February&nbsp;6, 2017, Greenbrier sold $275&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to the Initial Purchasers and entered into an Indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). The Indenture governs the Convertible Notes and contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of&nbsp;2.875% payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on February&nbsp;1 and August&nbsp;1 of each
year, beginning on August&nbsp;1, 2017. The Convertible Notes mature on February&nbsp;1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Convertible Notes are convertible into
shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock as further described under Item&nbsp;3.02 below. No sinking fund is provided for in the Indenture and Greenbrier may not redeem the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations
and rank equally in right of payment with Greenbrier&#146;s other senior unsecured debt. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Indenture provides that if the Company undergoes certain
types of fundamental changes prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, each Convertible Note holder has the option to require the Company to repurchase all or any of such holder&#146;s Convertible Notes for cash. The fundamental change
repurchase price will be&nbsp;100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date all as provided for in the Indenture. The
Indenture further provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture; defaults
with respect to certain other indebtedness; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. The Indenture also contains customary provisions regarding the payment of additional interest and special interest. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Convertible Notes were offered in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule&nbsp;144A in compliance with and
reliance on a private placement exemption from registration afforded by Section&nbsp;4(2) under the Securities Act of&nbsp;1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). The Convertible Notes and any common stock issuable upon their conversion
may be offered and resold only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. The Convertible Notes were sold to the Initial Purchasers on February&nbsp;6, 2017 for cash for 100% of
their principal amount. The Company estimates that the </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes were approximately $265.5&nbsp;million, after deducting estimated fees and expenses of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million and the discount to
the Initial Purchasers of approximately $8.3&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes, in
multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November&nbsp;1, 2023 only under the following circumstances: (i)&nbsp;during any fiscal quarter commencing
after the fiscal quarter ending on May&nbsp;31, 2017 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii)&nbsp;during the five business day period after any five
consecutive trading day period (the &#147;measurement period&#148;) in which the &#147;trading price&#148; (as defined under the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than
98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (iii)&nbsp;upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described under the Indenture. On or after
November&nbsp;1, 2023 a holder may convert all or any portion of its Convertible Notes, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of whether the foregoing conditions have been satisfied. The
Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock at an initial conversion rate of&nbsp;16.6234 shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $60.16&nbsp;per share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments as provided for in the Indenture. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon a conversion of the notes, Greenbrier may elect to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and
shares as provided for in the Indenture. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If Greenbrier undergoes certain types of make-whole fundamental changes, then, in certain circumstances, the
Company will pay a fundamental change make-whole premium upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change by increasing the conversion rate on such Convertible Notes. The amount of the fundamental
change make-whole premium, if any, will be based on the price paid, or deemed to be paid, per share of the Company&#146;s common stock in the transaction constituting the make-whole fundamental change and the effective date of the make-whole
fundamental change. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the Convertible Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to

announced today that it has increased the size of its previously announced offering of Senior Convertible Notes due 2024 to an aggregate principal amount of $250&nbsp;million (the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Notes are being offered in the United States
only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). Greenbrier has also granted the initial purchasers a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT>
option to purchase up to an additional $25&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of Notes on the same terms and conditions. Greenbrier expects to close the offering of the Notes on or about February&nbsp;6, 2017, subject to satisfaction of various
customary closing conditions.<B> </B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will be Greenbrier&#146;s general, unsecured, senior obligations and will rank equally in
right of payment with all of Greenbrier&#146;s existing and future senior unsecured debt. The Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 2.875% payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February&nbsp;1 and August&nbsp;1 of each year, commencing
August&nbsp;1, 2017. The Notes will mature on February&nbsp;1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will be convertible into shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock pursuant to their terms, based on an initial conversion rate of
16.6234 shares of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $60.16 per share of common stock. This represents a premium of 37.50% above the last
reported sale price of Greenbrier&#146;s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January&nbsp;31, 2017 (which was $43.75 per share). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to November&nbsp;1, 2023, the Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes only upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions and during certain periods, and, thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled, at Greenbrier&#146;s election, in cash, shares of
Greenbrier&#146;s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to adjustment in certain events. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Greenbrier intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions of,
or investments in, complementary businesses and products or repayment or repurchase of a portion of its indebtedness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes and the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Greenbrier (<U>www.gbrx.com</U>), headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon, is a leading international supplier of equipment and services to the
freight rail transportation markets. Greenbrier designs, builds and markets freight railcars in North America and Europe, builds freight railcars and rail castings in Brazil through a strategic partnership, and builds and markets marine barges in
North America. Through our European manufacturing operations, we recently began delivery of US-designed tank cars in Saudi Arabia. In October 2016, we entered into an agreement with Astra Rail Management GmbH to form a new company, Greenbrier-Astra
Rail, which will create an end-to-end, Europe-based freight railcar manufacturing, engineering and repair business. We expect this combination will be completed during 2017. We are a leading provider of wheel services, parts, leasing and other
services to the railroad and related transportation industries in North America and a provider of freight railcar repair, refurbishment and retrofitting services in North America through a joint venture partnership with Watco Companies, LLC. Through
other joint ventures we produce rail castings, tank heads and other railcar components. Greenbrier owns a lease fleet of over 8,500&nbsp;railcars and performs management services for over 265,000&nbsp;railcars. </P>

not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference
include, but are not limited to, reported backlog and awards that are not indicative of Greenbrier&#146;s financial results; uncertainty or changes in the credit markets and financial services industry; high levels of indebtedness and compliance
with the terms of Greenbrier&#146;s indebtedness; write-downs of goodwill, intangibles and other assets in future periods; sufficient availability of borrowing capacity; fluctuations in demand for newly manufactured railcars or failure to obtain
orders as anticipated in developing forecasts; loss of one or more significant customers; customer payment defaults or related issues; policies and priorities of the federal government regarding international trade and infrastructure; sovereign risk
to contracts, exchange rates or property rights; actual future costs and the availability of materials and a trained workforce; failure to design or manufacture new products or technologies or to achieve certification or market acceptance of new
products or technologies; steel or specialty component price fluctuations and availability and scrap surcharges; changes in product mix and the mix between segments; labor disputes, energy shortages or operating difficulties that might disrupt
manufacturing operations or the flow of cargo; production difficulties and product delivery delays as a result of, among other matters, costs or inefficiencies associated with expansion, start-up, or changing of production lines or changes in
production rates, changing technologies, transfer of production between facilities or non-performance of alliance partners, subcontractors or suppliers; ability to obtain suitable contracts for the sale of leased equipment and risks related to car
