On January 25, 2016, consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and in light of a recent ruling by the Delaware Chancery Court in a proceeding not involving Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the "Company"), the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has amended Article III, Section 9, of the Company&#x2019;s Amended and Restated By-Laws to provide that directors may be removed in a manner consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and amended Article VIII, Section 1 to remove references to Article III, Section 9.   The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>	The Board also proposed and declared advisable amendments to the Company&#x2019;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as follows: to Article NINTH, paragraph (f) to provide that directors may be removed in a manner consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, to Article TWELFTH to remove references to Article III, Section 9 of the By-Laws, and to Article THIRTEENTH, to provide that it shall not apply to Article NINTH, paragraph (f).<br><br>In addition, the Board has approved a resolution directing the Company not to enforce the current Article NINTH, paragraph (f)  in its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such that the Board will comply with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and any director of the Company&#x2019;s Board or the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the Corporation&#x2019;s then outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.<br>	<br>	The amendment to the By-Laws was effective as of January 25, 2016.

in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, the Associated Press or a comparable
national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and a &#147;public announcement&#148; shall be deemed to have been made on such date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;8. <U>Inspectors</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall appoint inspectors of election to act as
judges of the voting and to determine those entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any
adjournment thereof, in advance of such meeting, but if the Board fails to make such appointments
or if an appointee fails to serve, the presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders may appoint
substitute inspectors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;9. <U>Voting</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or in the
Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder on the record date
for the meeting. The ability of the stockholders to engage in cumulative voting is specifically
denied. If the Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share
on any matter, every reference in these By-Laws to a majority or other proportion of shares of
stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such shares of stock. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons
to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Such proxy shall be filed with
the Secretary before the vote at such meeting of stockholders. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an
interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with
which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.
A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy
bearing a later date with the Secretary. Except as set forth below in this Section&nbsp;9 or as
required by applicable law, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock which has voting power present in person or represented by proxy and which
has actually voted shall decide any question properly brought before such meeting. Voting at
meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless so directed by the presiding officer
of the meeting or the Board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;For purposes of non-contested elections of incumbent directors, a vote of the holders of a
majority of stock which was actually voted means that the number of shares voted &#147;for&#148; an incumbent
director&#146;s election must exceed the number of votes cast &#147;against&#148; that director&#146;s election, with
&#147;abstentions&#148; and &#147;broker nonvotes&#148; not counted as votes cast either &#147;for&#148; or &#147;against&#148; that
director&#146;s election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of
directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes present in person or
represented by proxy at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. An
election of directors shall be considered contested if the number of nominees standing for election
at any meeting of stockholders exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the
determination that an election is &#147;contested&#148; to be made by the Secretary within 30&nbsp;days following
the close of the applicable notice of Nomination period set forth in Section&nbsp;7 of this Article&nbsp;II,
based on whether one or more notices of Nomination were timely filed in accordance with said
Section&nbsp;7 (provided that the determination that an election is a &#147;contested election&#148; shall be
determinative only as to the timeliness of a notice of Nomination and not otherwise as to its
validity). If, prior to the time the Corporation mails its initial proxy statement in connection
with such election of directors, one or more notices of Nomination are withdrawn such that the
number of candidates for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be
elected, the election shall not be considered a contested election.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;If an incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that
is not a contested election, the director shall promptly tender his or her irrevocable resignation
to the Chairman of the Board following certification of the vote. Thereafter, the Board shall
decide, through a process managed by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (excluding
the nominee in question from all Board and Committee deliberations), whether to accept such
resignation within 90&nbsp;days of the date of such resignation. The Board in making its decision may
consider any factors and other information that it considers appropriate or relevant. The Board&#146;s
explanation of its decision shall be disclosed promptly in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or in a press release that is widely disseminated. If such
incumbent director&#146;s resignation is accepted by the Board, then such director shall immediately
cease to be a member of the Board upon the date of action taken by the Board to accept such
resignation. If such incumbent director&#146;s resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director
will continue to serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her subsequent resignation or
removal.

for director is not elected and such nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board may fill

Board pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 of Article&nbsp;III.

the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of
business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of any such
meeting, including, without limitation, by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than
stockholders of the Corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting of
stockholders, by ascertaining whether any stockholder or his or her proxy may be excluded from any
meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his or her sole
discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings
thereat, and by determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask
questions at any meeting of stockholders.

Chairman&#146;s absence, by the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer&#146;s absence, by
an officer of the Corporation designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation by a
Chairman chosen by vote of the stockholders at the meeting.&nbsp; The Secretary or Assistant Secretary
shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the Secretary&#146;s or Assistant Secretary&#146;s absence, the
Chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.

Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, a written waiver signed by the person entitled to
notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before, at
or after the time stated in such notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.&nbsp; Attendance of a
