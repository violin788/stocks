</FONT>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 18pt"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt"><B>TO WHOM DOES THE CODE APPLY?</B>
<BR>
Unless otherwise noted, our Code applies to all employees, officers and directors (&#147;you&#148;) of Dr
Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#147;company&#148; or &#147;we&#148;) in the U.S and other countries
we operate. We also expect our consultants, vendors, contractors and other third parties with whom
we do business to abide by the portions of our Code that are applicable to our relationship. Note
that in certain cases, the policies may apply to you, your family members and persons who live with
you.
</FONT>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>DOES THIS CODE COVER ALL OF MY OBLIGATIONS?</B>
<BR>
In this Code, we provide guidance, but cannot list all activities or behaviors that may be
inappropriate. This guidance is not intended to cover all potential situations, and the examples
provided here do not limit the generality of the Code or other policies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>DO OTHER POLICIES APPLY?</B>
<BR>
Yes. Our Code is a starting point for understanding your obligations. Other policies apply, some of
which are referenced in this Code. These other related policies may be provided to you or are
available to you on the company intranet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHO DO I ASK IF I HAVE A QUESTION?</B>
<BR>
If you have questions about how to interpret this Code, or whether areas of the Code may be waived
in relation to your activities, you may ask through our Speaking Up! reporting channels. Please
note that compliance responsibility ultimately rests with you.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHO MUST APPROVE A WAIVER?</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>If circumstances are unclear and you believe that a waiver of any provision of this Code is
warranted, you must disclose all relevant facts and make such request through the general counsel&#146;s
office. Waivers for employees, other than executive officers and the principal accounting officer
or controller, may only be made by the General Counsel. Waivers for executive officers and the
principal accounting officer or controller shall only be made by either the audit committee of the
board of directors or the board of directors. Waivers for a board member shall be made only by the
board of directors.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>WHO REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE CODE?</B>
<BR>
The board of directors reviews and approves our Code of Conduct. Other policies may be reviewed and
approved by the board and/or other senior management. The audit committee of the board of directors
and the general counsel&#146;s office monitor compliance with this Code and take appropriate actions to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>RESPECT & PROMOTE DIVERSITY</B>
<BR>
Just as each of our brands brings its own flavor to our product portfolio, each DPS employee brings
his or her own unique set of experiences, perspectives and backgrounds to our business. When we
take ACTION at DPS, we do so without regard to sex, race, color, national origin, ancestry,
religion, creed, age, marital status, gender, gender identity or expression, disability, medical
condition, covered veteran or military status, sexual orientation, genetic information<B>, </B>or any
other status protected under federal, state or local law. Accordingly, unwelcome conduct based on
any of these protected characteristics is forbidden.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">We&#146;re committed to diversity and equal opportunity and prohibit discrimination as well as unwelcome
and discriminatory behavior. This includes conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive or
hostile environment. This conduct can take many forms, including physical actions, spoken or
written comments, and multimedia.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Regardless of the form it takes, harassment negatively impacts individual work performance and our
workplace as a whole, and will not be tolerated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">See our <B>Equal Opportunity and Non-Harassment Policy and Human Rights Policy.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>ENSURE A SAFE WORKPLACE</B>
<BR>
Safety is everyone&#146;s responsibility at DPS. We all are accountable for providing a safe working
environment, which means that you should immediately report any unsafe conditions or activities
through your supervisor, a member of the human resources team or our Speaking Up! hotline. This
includes violations of safety laws, local safety rules or security procedures; threats or acts of
violence against company property, employees or customers; vandalism; and the presence of weapons
or prohibited substances on company premises.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN WORKING RELATIONSHIPS</B>
<BR>
Given the potential for conflicts of interest and the inherent risks such relationships could pose
to effective working relationships, a person may not supervise a family member, and a person must
not enter into a romantic or similarly close relationship with any person he or she supervises.
Moreover, a family member of an officer or director may not be hired, regardless of position,
without approval from both human resources and the general counsel&#146;s office.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 18pt"><FONT style="font-size: 11pt"><I>We value and respect our customers, suppliers, competitors and government authorities. In our

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>PROHIBIT BRIBERY</B>
<BR>
We conduct our business with integrity and strictly prohibit any sort of bribery, including by any
person acting directly or indirectly on our behalf and whether for our domestic or foreign
subsidiaries. You should also be mindful of the appearance of impropriety and our policies on gifts
and entertainment as explained below in Conflicts of Interest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">In any dealing with government officials, additional laws and policies apply. Various national and
local laws make it a crime to bribe government officials. In addition, under U.S. law, it is
illegal to give anything of value to a foreign official, whether by our own employee or persons
acting on our behalf and whether by our domestic or foreign operations. Violations can result in
criminal and civil liability for you and the company. Even an offer, promise or authorization of a
bribe or a nominal payment or gift may violate law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">See our <B>Bribery and Foreign Corrupt Practices Policy </B>for further explanation of the substantial
legal requirements and our strict rules, including on gifts and entertainment, which you must
comply with in dealing with government and foreign officials.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>COMPLY WITH COMPETITION & ANTITRUST LAWS</B>
<BR>
We strive to compete fairly and are committed to complying with applicable laws, including
antitrust laws covering the pricing, promotion, distribution, purchase and sale of our products, as
well as our relationships between manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, customers and
competitors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">Violations of these laws may result in fines and imprisonment. Some activities may be illegal and
should be avoided, such as agreements between competitors to set prices or allocate territories or
customers. In order to avoid the appearance of impropriety, you should also generally avoid any
discussion of prices, terms, distribution, production, customers or territories with a competitor.
Antitrust and competition laws may also restrict the tying of the purchase of one product with
another, certain exclusive dealing arrangements, setting of resale prices and other activities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The laws and their application to individual circumstances are complex. Moreover, because some of
our bottlers are owned by brand owners, we must be aware of those relationships and ensure that our
discussions and any confidential information we share are appropriate. If you have responsibility
for the sale or marketing of our products, you should familiarize yourself with these laws and our
Antitrust Policy and always consult with the legal department when you have questions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">See our <B>Antitrust Policy </B>for further guidance on antitrust laws and additional discussion of
improper and proper behavior in dealing with competitors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</B>
<BR>
We are accountable for ensuring that our personal interests do not impact our ability to make sound
business decisions. Conflicts may arise when your personal or family interests may interfere with
the company&#146;s in any way or may affect your objectivity and effectiveness, or when you receive
improper personal benefits. You may not engage in any activity that creates a conflict of interest,
or the appearance of one, between you and the company. Moreover, you may not use our property,
position or information for personal gain and you may not compete with us. The following are
examples and guidelines:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt"><B>Outside Investments and Business. </B></FONT><FONT style="font-size: 11pt">A conflict of interest may arise as a result of your
relationship (including any financial investment or loan) with a competitor or with another entity
with whom the company is doing or is seeking to do business or where a relationship interferes with
or may interfere with your responsibilities to the company. A conflict of interest may also arise
if you take company business opportunities for yourself or direct those opportunities to third
parties (unless the company has turned the opportunity down and it clearly does not conflict with
the company&#146;s business interests). If you desire to become a director, officer, employee, owner,
consultant or enter into any other business relationship with a competitor or any other entity with
whom the company conducts business or is seeking to conduct business, then you should consult your
supervisor and the general counsel to determine if that relationship constitutes a conflict.

We are committed to providing full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure of

obligations, and it&#146;s important to remember that fraudulent or misleading reporting or improper
transactions can result in civil or criminal penalties to the individuals involved and the company.
All transactions must be properly approved and accurately reflected on our books and records,
accounting and financial reporting. Estimates and guidance on future performance, though subject to

report any error, deficiency or noncompliance with internal accounting controls.

We should be good stewards of company resources. Your use of company resources, such as spending

purposes and required approvals and be backed with proper documentation. Our Authority and Expense
Policies explain the appropriate types and amounts of spending, contracts, commitments and other
actions, as well as who must approve certain actions, the documentation you must have and how you
must submit it. Likewise, our IT User Policy outlines requirements when using company IT resources
including information on inappropriate conduct and monitoring of activities.

<BR>
In your role, you may become aware of confidential information about DPS and our finances, sales,
products, employees or third parties we do business with. Unauthorized or inappropriate disclosure
or use of confidential information is prohibited. You may not use such information for personal
gain and should take reasonable steps to protect it. You should not provide it to other parties,
except for proper business purposes with proper confidentiality agreements. These confidentiality
obligations continue after your relationship with us ends.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>ENSURE FAIR DISCLOSURE TO INVESTORS</B>
<BR>
In particular, we must ensure fair disclosure to investors. Applicable laws govern how and when we
disclose material information to the public market, and you must strictly comply with our
obligations under law and our Disclosure Policy. Only the CEO, CFO and designated investor
relations and corporate affairs representatives may speak with investors, the financial community
or media without prior approval. Internally, material non-public information should be controlled
on a need-to-know basis. Formally approved news releases and SEC filings are the primary means of
disclosing such information. If you believe such information has been inappropriately disclosed,
notify the general counsel&#146;s office immediately.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt"><B>OBEY INSIDER TRADING LAWS</B>

jail terms.

DPS encourages voluntary personal participation with the political process on your own time and in
a manner that is consistent with relevant laws and company guidelines. However, you should speak as
an individual and avoid the appearance that you are speaking as our representative, unless
authorized. Eligible employees may make personal donations to the DPS political action committee.
Personal political donations will not be reimbursed, whether through an expense account, bonus or
otherwise. You may not use company funds, facilities and other assets (including nominal
contributions of our products) to support, directly or indirectly, any political candidates without
advance written approval from the government affairs team and the general counsel&#146;s office.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">All company and political action committee contributions and matters of public policy are managed
by our government affairs team. In certain states, DPS may make political contributions within
specific limits and reporting requirements, such as through a state beverage association. However,
the company may not make direct contributions or gifts of any kind, whether money, property, goods
or services, to any political candidate, campaign committee or other organization in connection
with any federal election.
