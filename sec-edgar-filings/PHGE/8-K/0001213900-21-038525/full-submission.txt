entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Securities Purchase Agreement, with certain institutional investors and certain
of the Company&rsquo;s directors and executive officers, or, collectively, the Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue
and sell, in a registered direct offering, or the Offering, by the Company directly to the Investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 units,
with each unit consisting of one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Common Stock, and one
warrant to purchase 0.75 of a share of Common Stock, each a warrant, at a purchase price of $4.00 per unit, for gross proceeds of
$15.0 million, before the deduction of fees and Offering expenses and assuming no exercise of the warrants. The shares of Common Stock and
warrants are immediately separable and will be issued separately. Subject to the NYSE American Stock Exchange, or NYSE American, approval,
the purchase price to the Company&rsquo;s directors and executive officers may be increased in order to comply with NYSE American rules.</P>

at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and will expire five years from the date such warrants first become exercisable. The warrants
will not be listed on the NYSE American Stock Market or any other exchange and no trading market for the warrants is expected to develop.
The Securities Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and customary conditions
to closing. The closing of the Offering is expected to occur on July 28, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing
conditions, including but not limited to the approval from the NYSE American.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Company recently entered into a non-binding term sheet with a
lender, or the Lender, with respect to a venture debt facility, or the Loan. The maximum amount of the Loan is $30.0 million, of which
$15.0 million will be funded upon closing of the Loan transaction, or the Closing. If completed, the Loan will be for a term of 48 months
from the Closing, which term may be extended to up to 60 months upon satisfaction of certain milestones. The interest rate on the Loan
will be the greater of (i) the Prime Rate minus 3.25% and (ii) 8.95%. During the first 18 months from the Closing the Company is expected
to pay only interest and not principle, which 18-month term may be extended to up to 30 months upon satisfaction of certain milestones.
The Loan is to be secured by the Company&rsquo;s assets, excluding intellectual property rights, or IPR, provided, however that the Company&rsquo;s
IPR will be subject to a negative pledge subject to customary exceptions such as licensing transactions in the ordinary course of business.
In connection with the Loan, the Company is expected to be subject to restrictions on activities customary for transactions of this type
including without limitation, restrictions on liens and indebtedness, payment of cash dividends, asset dispositions and down streaming,
guaranties and mergers. At this point the Company does not expect to grant warrants to the Lender in connection with the extension of
the Loan.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The above description of the Loan and the terms thereof is based on
the terms of a non-binding term sheet that of its nature cannot be enforced by or against the Company or the Lender. Such terms are subject
to further negotiations with the Lender and may further change due to a host of considerations, including tax structuring, diligence
by the Lender, market conditions and others and ultimately the Company may not be able to close the Loan transaction under the above
terms or any other terms.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This Current
Report on Form 8-K contains express or implied &ldquo;forward-looking statements&rdquo; within the meaning of the &ldquo;safe
harbor&rdquo; provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon
management&rsquo;s current beliefs, views, estimates and expectations, including as to the Company&rsquo;s industry, business
strategy, goals and expectations concerning its market position, strategic and future operations and other financial information.
For example, forward-looking statements include statements regarding the successful closing of the Offering, the proposed venture
debt transaction contemplated under a non-binding term sheet the Company recently entered into and the planned use of the net
proceeds from the Offering. In fact, the closing of the Offering is subject to various conditions and contingencies as are customary
in securities purchase agreements in the United States. If these conditions are not satisfied or the specified contingencies do not
occur, this Offering may not close. Further, the receipt and use of the proceeds is dependent on the completion of the Offering and
may not occur. Also</FONT>, <FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">the Company may not enter into a venture debt transaction pursuant to the
terms detailed in this Current Report on Form 8-K or at all. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances
of future performance. Instead, they are based only on the Company&rsquo;s management&rsquo;s current beliefs, expectations and
assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes
in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company&rsquo;s control. Actual results and
outcomes may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, investors should not rely on any
of these forward-looking statements and should review the risks and uncertainties described under the caption &ldquo;Risk
Factors&rdquo; in the Company&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and additional disclosures
the Company makes in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s website
at&nbsp;www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company undertakes
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws</FONT></P>

beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or
nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject

to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is
exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder&rsquo;s
determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates
and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation,
and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any
group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company&rsquo;s most recent periodic or annual report
filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice

been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without
regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring
corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the &ldquo;<U>Alternate Consideration</U>&rdquo;)
receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable
immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant).
For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value
of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash
or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in
a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the &ldquo;Successor Entity&rdquo;) to assume in writing all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(d) pursuant to written agreements in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental
Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity
evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding
number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable
and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental
Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account
the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock,
such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant
immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so
that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring
to the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall
assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor

shall require the prior written consent of such adversely affected Purchaser. Any amendment effected in accordance with this Section 5.5
shall be binding upon each Purchaser and holder of Securities and the Company.</P>

and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association,
a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group
with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently
protect and enforce its rights including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction
Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any Proceeding for such purpose.
Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For
reasons of administrative convenience only, each Purchaser and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through
Cooley. Cooley does not represent any of the Purchasers and only represents the Placement Agents. The Company has elected to provide all
Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested
to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other
Transaction Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company and the Purchasers collectively and not
between and among the Purchasers.&nbsp;</P>

its agreement with you as follows:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in">(a) On
the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained herein, and subject to all the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC shall be the Company&rsquo;s exclusive placement agents
(each a &ldquo;<B>Placement Agent</B>&rdquo; and collectively the <B>&ldquo;Placement Agents&rdquo;</B>), acting on a reasonable best
efforts basis, in connection with the sale by the Company of the Securities to the Investors in a proposed offering pursuant to the Registration
Statement, with the terms of the offering to be subject to market conditions and negotiations among the Company and the prospective Investors
(such offering shall be referred to herein as the &ldquo;<B>Offering</B>&rdquo;). As compensation for services rendered, and provided
that any of the Securities are sold to Investors in the Offering, on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1(c) hereof) of the Offering,
the Company shall pay to the Placement Agents a cash fee equal to six percent (6.0%) of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Offering
at the Closing other than with respect to proceeds raised from Investors who are directors or officers of the Company and their affiliates
(the &ldquo;<B>Placement Fee</B>&rdquo;). The sale of the Securities shall be made pursuant to subscription agreements in the form included

Agreement shall not give rise to any commitment by the Placement Agents to purchase any of the Securities, and the Placement Agents shall
have no authority to bind the Company to accept offers to purchase the Securities. Each Placement Agent represents and agrees that, without
the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute
a Free Writing Prospectus that would be required to be filed with the Commission. Each Placement Agent may, with the prior consent of
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), retain other brokers or dealers to act as sub-agents on its behalf in connection
with the Offering, the fees of which shall be paid out of such Placement Agent&rsquo;s portion of the Placement Fee.</P>

in writing by the Placement Agents and the Company (such date of payment and delivery being herein called the &ldquo;<B>Closing Date</B>&rdquo;).
All such actions taken at the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously. No Securities which the Company has agreed to sell
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for, or sold by the Company, until such Securities
shall have been delivered to the Investor thereof against payment therefor by such Investor. If the Company shall default in its obligations
to deliver the Securities to an Investor whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Placement Agents harmless
against any loss, claim or damage incurred by the Placement Agents arising from or as a result of such default by the Company.</P>

Company acknowledges and agrees that the Placement Agents are acting solely in the capacity of an arm&rsquo;s length contractual counterparty
to the Company with respect to the Offering contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the Offering) and
not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, the Placement Agents are
not advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The
Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation

Any such separate firm for one or more of the Placement Agents and any of their affiliates, directors and officers and their control persons,

omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall
be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the sale of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by it as set for
the on the cover page of the Final Prospectus Supplement, and benefits received by the Placement Agents shall be deemed to be equal to
their respective portion of the total Placement Fee. Relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Placement Agents, on the
other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by each such party, the intent of the parties
