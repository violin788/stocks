First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May&nbsp;1, 1990 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), duly executed and delivered by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). The terms of the
Securities include those stated in the Indenture and in the Officers&#146; Certificate dated May&nbsp;22, 2015 (the &#147;Officers&#146; Certificate&#148;) establishing certain terms of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture, those made part of
the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the &#147;TIA&#148;), and those set forth in this Security. This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, the Officers&#146;
Certificate and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Officers&#146; Certificate shall have the meanings assigned to them therein. The Securities are unsecured general

Securities will have a separate ISIN and Common Code. Additional Securities so issued will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the Securities. </P>

or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein having power to tax) (a &#147;Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction&#148;), unless the withholding of such taxes, assessments or other governmental charge is required by law or the official interpretation or administration thereof. The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth
below, pay as additional interest on the Securities such additional amounts (the &#147;additional amounts&#148;) as are necessary in order that the net payment by the Company of the principal of and interest on such Securities to a Holder who is not
a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, will not be less than the amount provided in such

November&nbsp;1, 1986, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May&nbsp;1, 1990 (together, the &#147;Indenture&#148;), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the
&#147;Trustee&#148;). The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.&nbsp;333-183449) (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), on August&nbsp;21, 2012 and the related prospectus supplement dated as of May&nbsp;19, 2015 (the &#147;Prospectus Supplement&#148;). In connection with the issuance and sale of
the Notes, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement dated May&nbsp;19, 2015 (the &#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;) among the Company and the Underwriters named therein. </P>

the Indenture, the Officers&#146; Certificate establishing the terms of the Notes (including the form of Note attached thereto), the Registration Statement, the Prospectus Supplement, the Underwriting Agreement and such other documents, corporate
records, certificates of public officials and instruments, and have considered such matters of law, as I have deemed appropriate as the basis for the opinions set forth below. I have assumed the authority of the Trustee to enter into the Indenture
and to authenticate the Notes, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. </P>

constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as (a)&nbsp;the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or similar
laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights generally and (b)&nbsp;the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). </P>
