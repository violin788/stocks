December&nbsp;5, 2024 (&#147;Stated Maturity&#148;) at the office or agency of the Company in London, United Kingdom or such other location or locations as may be provided for pursuant to the Indenture referred to herein, in such unified coin or
currency of the European Monetary Union as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest on said principal sum, in arrears, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as
defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or if no interest has been paid, from and including June&nbsp;5, 2019), to, but excluding, December&nbsp;5 of each year (the &#147;Interest Payment Date&#148;), beginning on
December&nbsp;5, 2019, at the rate of 0.250% per annum, at said offices or agencies, in like coin or currency, to, but excluding, the date on which said principal sum is paid in full. The Record Date with respect to each Interest Payment Date shall
be the close of business on December&nbsp;1 (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding the Interest Payment Date. Interest payable at Stated Maturity shall be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment
Date, Stated Maturity or any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the related payment for such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay. The interest payable on any Interest Payment Date (other than interest payable at Stated
Maturity) will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds, provided that the Company may elect that the payment of interest may be made by wire transfer or by check mailed to the registered address of the person entitled thereto as it
appears on the security register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the registered owner of the Securities is a common depositary of Euroclear/Clearstream or its nominee, payments of principal and interest shall be made in accordance with the

institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be
converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros. Any such payment so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under this Security or the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor

Banking, or its registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS (&#128;500,000,000) subject to adjustment from time to time as reflected on the Schedule of Increases and Decreases in Global Security attached hereto on
December&nbsp;5, 2027 (&#147;Stated Maturity&#148;) at the office or agency of the Company in London, United Kingdom or such other location or locations as may be provided for pursuant to the Indenture referred to herein, in such unified coin or
currency of the European Monetary Union as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest on said principal sum, in arrears, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as
defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or if no interest has been paid, from and including June&nbsp;5, 2019), to, but excluding, December&nbsp;5 of each year (the &#147;Interest Payment Date&#148;), beginning on
December&nbsp;5, 2019, at the rate of 0.625% per annum, at said offices or agencies, in like coin or currency, to, but excluding, the date on which said principal sum is paid in full. The Record Date with respect to each Interest Payment Date shall
be the close of business on December&nbsp;1 (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding the Interest Payment Date. Interest payable at Stated Maturity shall be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment
Date, Stated Maturity or any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the related payment for such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay. The interest payable on any Interest Payment Date (other than interest payable at Stated
Maturity) will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds, provided that the Company may elect that the payment of interest may be made by wire transfer or by check mailed to the registered address of the person entitled thereto as it
appears on the security register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the registered owner of the Securities is a common depositary of Euroclear/Clearstream or its nominee, payments of principal and interest shall be made in accordance with the
requirements of Euroclear/Clearstream. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If, on or after the date hereof, the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls
or other circumstances beyond the Company&#146;s control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public
institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be
converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros. Any such payment so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under this Security or the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor
the Paying Agent shall have any responsibility for effecting such currency conversions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The further provisions of this Security are continued in an

issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November&nbsp;1, 1986 and supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May&nbsp;1, 1990 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), duly executed and delivered by the Company and The Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;). The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and in the Officers&#146; Certificate dated June&nbsp;5, 2019 (the &#147;Officers&#146;
Certificate&#148;) establishing certain terms of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the &#147;TIA&#148;), and those set forth in this Security. This
Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, the Officers&#146; Certificate and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the
Officers&#146; Certificate shall have the meanings assigned to them therein. The Securities are unsecured general obligations of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

Securities, create and issue additional Securities with the same terms and conditions as the Securities, except for the issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest thereon, provided that if such additional Securities are not fungible
with the Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional Securities will have a separate ISIN and Common Code. Additional Securities so issued will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the Securities. </P>

payment by the Company of the principal of and interest on such Securities to a Holder who is not a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge
imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, will not be less than the amount provided in such Securities to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply: </P>

having the power to tax, as a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, relating to the Securities shall

prior to the declaration of maturity of the Securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default under the Indenture relating to the Securities and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued upon the

basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros. Any such payment so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Securities or the Indenture. </P>
