trend and rebound in our markets as customers that had been reluctant to commit to larger purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic during

Company&rsquo;s overall performance in the first quarter of 2021, which reinforces the belt-tightening we made before the pandemic hit.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m
especially pleased with the significant term debt repayments the Company has made thus far in 2021, which approximate $8.8 million and
which will save the Company approximately $1.1 million in cash interest expense on an annual basis.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Vincent S. Miceli^ Thank you. Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and
thank you, everyone, for joining our call today to discuss NXT-ID's unaudited financial and operating results for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, and a general update on the business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As we've done in the past, Vin will discuss the financial summary,
and I will then hand the call over to Kevin O'Connor, who will provide an update on the LogicMark business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">During this afternoon's call, Kevin and I will be making forward-looking
statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding
our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please
note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements including
factors identified and discussed in our SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty
to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place any undue reliance on such statements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So before I head into the financial summary, I would just like to preface
that discussion with a quick reminder that when you look at the comparability to the first quarter of 2020, the first quarter of 2020
was, for all intents and purposes, a pre-COVID-19 quarter for us -- or at least 85% of the quarter was pre-COVID and so the results are
obviously much more favorable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">And so from a comparability standpoint, it's questionable as to whether
or not, we're really comparing apples to apples or apples to oranges, if you will. And you should also be reminded that Q1 2020, from
a profitability standpoint, was the first time in the Company's history that it had positive net income.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So without further ado, I'll head into the numbers. Revenues for the
three months ended March 31, 2020, came in at approximately $2.4 million compared to $3.7 million for the same 2020 period. Gross profit
for the three months ended March 31, 2020, came in at $1.6 million compared to approximately $2.8 million for the same period.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Operating expenses, namely SG&amp;A for the three months ended March
31, 2021, were approximately $2.3 million compared to $1.8 million for the comparable 2020 period. That increase of roughly $0.5 million,
I should point out, is all noncash related. It actually had to do with stock comp expense.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So from a cash standpoint, if you will, the numbers were virtually
spot on to the same 2020 period from last year. The operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2021, came in at about $783,000.
And for the three months ended March 31, 2020, operating income was approximately $1 million. Interest expense for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, came in just under $900,000 versus $600,000 or thereabouts from the first quarter of 2020. The increase was all noncash-related
as well.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As you know, from our correspondence and SEC filings, we prepaid a
big chunk in the first quarter of 2021, we paid down -- prepaid, I should say, $5 million, and the accounting rules require that we accelerate
the amortization of the deferred debt related costs on the Company's balance sheet. So again, all noncash related, which obviously is
a good thing.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Non-GAAP operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
adjusted for things like depreciation and amortization of intangibles and any other related noncash items was approximately breakeven
in the first quarter of 2021 compared to approximately $1.3 million for the same 2020 period. Non-GAAP net loss for the three months ended
March 31, 2021, adjusted for the same type of noncash items was approximately $312,000 compared to net income of approximately $860,000.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March
31 was approximately $1 million. And that $1 million was to pay down a big chunk of our accounts payable that was carried over from the
year-end 2020. I recall of that number was about $0.5 million. And we also, in an effort to bolster our inventory levels, as we start
to come out of the COVID-19 environment, we increased our inventory deposits by a couple of $100,000 as well to increase our inventory
levels in anticipation of that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As I mentioned already, in Q1, we prepaid roughly $5 million. In addition,
we made $0.5 million worth of scheduled amortization payments, which obviously was one of our key objectives that we laid out about 1.5
years ago. And the cash balance at March 31 was approximately $8.5 million. And as you also know, in May of this year, we prepaid another
$3 million with some of that cash that we had on the books at March 31.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So we've made substantial strides in reducing our leverage and getting
the debt reduced significantly. And so with that, I'll turn it over now to Kevin O'Connor, who will provide an update for you on the LogicMark
business. Kevin?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Kevin O&rsquo;Connor^ Thanks, Vin. So I'll go through kind of a business
review of LogicMark. I won't go into the numbers because Vin had just gone through the numbers at the NXT level when really a lot of what
role out was the LogicMark business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So just as kind of a recap on the business overall and you've been
talked about COVID-19, I'll address it a little bit. We're not hiding behind COVID-19, but we want to make sure that people understand
it, it had a very real impact on the business, going back over the past 14 months. The VA, as many of you know, represents a significant
portion of the LogicMark business, and VA is the largest healthcare system in the country.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So as the country was dealing with COVID, the VA was probably more
heavily impacted than most healthcare systems, it really limited the number of patient visits, and our products are typically prescribed
or the orders are written for them as veterans visit clinics and medical centers. And so as that model changed through COVID, it had a
significant impact.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">It has been talked about in the business model, we adjusted our cost
structure. We managed the costs and really managed the workforce to try and make sure that we're still supporting the customers, but keeping
an eye on the overhead.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"></P>

<!-- Field: Page; Sequence: 2 -->
    <DIV STYLE="margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; border-bottom: Black 1.5pt solid"><P STYLE="text-align: center; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt"><!-- Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo -->2<!-- Field: /Sequence --></P></DIV>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So going into 2021, then talked about the increased inventory. We did
bring in additional product because we wanted to make sure as we were coming out of that ramping backup that we had the product to meet
the demand, we were careful throughout 2020 and going into 2021 that we weren't sitting on excess inventory. So I feel pretty strongly
that the team in Louisville has done a really nice job of managing that portion of it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Through the first four months, this is obviously Q1 review, but we
do have April results, but through the first four months, we've seen the business ramp up nicely. January and February really started
out, slow March, we saw a nice uptick, and that continued into April, we've also seen that continuing into May.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So we think that as you look at the country opening up and the impact
of vaccinations that the VA specifically is really benefiting from that. They've opened up clinics, and they are seeing a lot of patients.
So we've geared up to make sure that we're meeting that demand as well, and we feel optimistic that we'll continue to grow. And so we're
making sure that we scale the business accordingly from our operations and inventory standpoint.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">A couple of items that I want to address because we've talked about
it in the past, and I know there have been some questions on it before, but just provide an update on the GSA contract schedule. We did
submit the GSA schedule contract in fourth quarter 2020. About the time that we got our 4G LTE products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So we submitted that at the time that product came in. We got a contracting
officer assigned to our case at the beginning of Q1. And our hope was, and I think we had probably given some guidance that we were hoping
to have the GSA approved by the end of March, it got delayed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">And a lot of what drove that was internally at GSA. They updated all
current GSA holders, had to update their pricing in terms of conditions. So as a new schedule, it was being reviewed, we got put on a
back burner.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So it's been somewhat frustrating, but the process has continued to
move along. And we do have a contracting officer assigned to it. We're in communication with the contracting officer and it's being evaluated,
we're providing answers as quickly as questions come in. And I'm confident that it will move through the process and that we will get
a positive outcome. It's a really clean offer.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We've got a long history with the VA specifically and with government
agencies. So I really don't have any concerns that there are going to be any issues that come up.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As we've talked about, we have continued to sell to the VA while we're
going through this process. So that hasn't held up any of their sales. And once we get confirmation that it's been approved, at that point,
we will launch a campaign to be proactive into other government channels because with the GSA schedule, we can market through any government
agency, both federal, state, county and also through tribal nations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So we've been putting together a campaign and marketing plan to take
advantage of that. And again, I remain optimistic that we will be able to get that approval and continue to build on that.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The other issue that we've spent time talking about is product development.
I'll start with an update on our 4G LTE product. We did release that product as I mentioned in the fourth quarter. And in Q1, we really
-- as we've started to ramp up, had had great success with it. It's operating extremely well. We are really happy with the performance
of it. And at this point, it replaced our 3G units.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So everything that we've got going out the door as a cellular solution
is 4G right now. And again, we feel pretty optimistic that it will continue to ramp up. The VA has been very accepting of it and their
veterans love it. So again, we think that throughout the year, we're going to continue to see growth there.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The other product that we've been working on and we've spent some time
talking about is our WiFi product. So we had talked before about the development, the testing, the field testing and our timelines for
production and release, and we are still in development of it. We ran into some issues when we did the field testers. So the process after
we did the pilot production run was as we put units in the field, we were evaluating performance and functionality, there were some issues
that came up.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So the engineering team, both internally and the third-party engineering
group that we brought into to help push the product over the finish line, are working on those and addressing them. We found that there's
a readjustment of board design that needs to be done. There are some components that are being changed. So that is in progress. It's continuing
to move forward.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition to that, we also, after the pilot production run, found
some issues with the case design. So as we're redesigning the board, we're also making modifications to the case that will improve the
manufacturability of the product. It will make it much quicker to manufacture and ultimately, less costly. So we remain, again, positive
about the product and its development.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We have done some field testing, as I've mentioned, and the feedback
that we're getting for the product has been excellent. People that are testing it, people that we have talked to about the product, we
believe that it's going to be really well received in the market, both at the consumer level and also in the institutional level where
we believe that there's an opportunity for it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So we'll continue to do the development once we get the new board out,
it's got to go through certification. We will get additional units into the field test that and make sure that the development in that
product is solid.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">As we launch a new product and because of our life safety product,
it's critical that we know that when that thing goes out into the field that it's providing the functionality that it's designed for.
And that it's going to provide the life safety that people are looking for when they require it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Through the whole development, we have been working on a back-end.
So it will be accessible through an app, and that's how the communication will take place. The app and the back-end portal development
has gone extremely well. And so that's ready to go as soon as we have the hardware issues resolved, and in addition to using the WiFi
product, the app and the back-end portal, will be a platform that we'll be able to use for launch and future hardware developments off
of it.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

and where it will fit within the marketplace, it will be extremely positive and that it will be a successful launch.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So we're frustrated at the delays that have taken place, but we are

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Vincent S. Miceli^ Okay. Great, Kevin, thank you. Sarah, I guess, at
this point, we can open it up for some questions, if anybody has a question they would like to ask.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Operator^ (Operator Instructions). And there are no questions at this
time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Vincent S. Miceli^ Okay. Thank you, Sarah.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So in summary, I would just like to have some of the investors who
were investors for the last couple of years reflect back and also the newer investors reflect back on where we were roughly 1.5 years
ago when Kevin and I stepped in here to take over the management of the business. If you'll recall, after we did our assessment, we identified
three key objectives. And sometimes, I chuckle a little bit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">I usually start with the SG&amp;A, but being an accountant by trade,
I usually go to the numbers first, but this time, I'll start with the new products and flip it around a little bit. Essentially, we went
back in September of 2019, we essentially had no products. We had two products in the pipeline. We had the 4G guardian alert that Kevin
referenced earlier, and we also had the WiFi product in its early stages of development.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">And so at this point, today, obviously, as you know, based on what
Kevin suggested and talked about, we're selling the product. The product is an excellent, excellent product. It's just a tremendous product
for the VA in its clinics. And we think it's the best value proposition for the U.S. government.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So great strides there. We're hoping -- we struggled a little bit with
the WiFi. We're hopefully going to be back on target with production for late this year, very excited about that and so great strides
there.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The debt when we took over back in September, the debt was at $13.8
million. We're now sitting at $2.2 million in debt. That's an interest savings over that timeframe of $1.5 million at the current interest
rates, just a phenomenal progress in that area.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">And then lastly, when we stepped in the SG&amp;A expenses on an annual
basis, approximated somewhere in the range of $11.5 million to $12 million, we're currently at $6.5 million in an annual run rate. So
just phenomenal progress in rightsizing the business for revenue growth going forward.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">And so I just wanted to give you a quick synopsis. I believe it's a
lot of progress in that last 1.5 years. So just wanted to share that with you.<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">And then lastly, I was advised this morning by one of our Board members
that I'm being replaced as the Company's CEO. I don't know who my replacement will be. Any further inquiry should be made directly to
the Board.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So at this time, I'd like to thank all of the investors for their support
and loyalty. We're very confident that the Company will be -- it's in my estimation, and I'm sure Kevin would echo this, the Company has
teed up perfectly for revenue growth, and we look forward to taking it to the next level.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">So with that, I would tell you to have a great afternoon, and thank
you for joining the call. Have a good day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Operator^ Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.</P>
