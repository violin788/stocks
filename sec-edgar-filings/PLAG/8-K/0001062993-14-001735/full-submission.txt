<B>Item 5.08  Stockholders Directors Nominations</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
  On March 28, 2014, the board of directors of American Lorain Corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) set June 9, 2014 as the date of its Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the close of business on April 25, 2014, as the record date for determining
the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and entitled to vote at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (&ldquo;2014 Annual Meeting&rdquo;).  In addition to this announcement, the Company will separately send notice and proxy materials to
stockholders of record. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
 Because the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before the one-year anniversary of our 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (&ldquo;2013 Annual Meeting&rdquo;), we are informing our stockholders of the revised deadline for the
submission of stockholders proposals and director nominees for consideration at our 2014 Annual Meeting.  Proposals by stockholders and submissions by stockholders of director nominees for consideration at the 2014 Annual Meeting should be submitted
in writing to the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors Office and Corporate Secretary at: American Lorain Corporation, c/o Board of Director Office, Beihuan Zhong Road, Junan County, Shandong, People&rsquo;s Republic of China, 276600.  Any proposals
relating to director nominees should contain the name, holdings of our securities and contact information of the person making the nomination, the candidate's name, address and other contact information, any direct or indirect holdings of our
securities by the nominee, any information required to be disclosed about directors under applicable securities laws and/or stock exchange requirements, information regarding related party transactions with our company and/or the stockholder
submitting the nomination; any actual or potential conflicts of interest, the nominee's biographical data, current public and private company affiliations, employment history and qualifications and status as "independent" under applicable securities
laws and stock exchange requirements.  </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
 For all proposals and nominations by stockholders to be timely received, regardless of whether the proposals or nominations are intended for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2014 Annual Meeting, a stockholders&rsquo; notice must be
delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors Office and Corporate Secretary on or before the close of business on April 14, 2014. Any stockholders proposal or nomination delivered or received after the close of
business on April 14, 2014 will be untimely and will not be properly brought before the 2014 Annual Meeting. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
 Proposals by stockholders and submissions by stockholders of director nominees, if intended for inclusion in the proxy statement, must comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, including Rule 14a-8
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. </P>
