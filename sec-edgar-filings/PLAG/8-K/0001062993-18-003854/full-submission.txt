or distribution of such Exchange Shares; (c) has been advised and understands
that the Exchange Shares (i) are being issued in reliance upon one or more
exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws, (ii) have not been and shall not be registered
under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities Laws and, therefore,
must be held indefinitely and cannot be resold unless such Exchange Shares are
registered under the Securities Act and all applicable state securities Laws,
unless exemptions from registration are available and (iii) are subject to
additional restrictions on transfer pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement; (d) is
aware that an investment in the Parent is a speculative investment and is
subject to the risk of complete loss; and (e) acknowledges that the Parent is
under no obligation hereunder to register the Exchange Shares under the
Securities Act. No Seller has any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer, or
grant participations to such Person, or to any third Person, with respect to the
Exchange Shares. By reason of Seller&#146;s business or financial experience, or by
reason of the business or financial experience of Seller&#146;s &#147;purchaser

the Parent and of protecting its interests in connection with this investment.
Seller has carefully read and understands all materials provided by or on behalf
of the Parent or its Representatives to Seller or Seller&#146;s Representatives
pertaining to an investment in the Parent and has consulted, as Seller has
deemed advisable, with its own attorneys, accountants or investment advisors
with respect to the investment contemplated hereby and its suitability for
Seller. Seller acknowledges that the Exchange Shares are subject to dilution for
events not under the control of Seller. Seller has completed its independent
inquiry and has relied fully upon the advice of its own legal counsel,
accountant, financial and other Representatives in determining the legal, tax,
financial and other consequences of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and the suitability of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby for Seller and its particular circumstances, and, except as
set forth herein, has not relied upon any representations or advice by the
Purchaser, the Parent or their Representatives. Seller acknowledges and agrees
that Seller has not been guaranteed or represented to by any Person, (i) any
specific amount or the event of the distribution of any cash, property or other
interest in the Parent or (ii) the profitability or value of the Exchange Shares
in any manner whatsoever. Seller: (A) has been represented by independent
counsel (or has had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel and has declined to do so);
(B) has had the full right and opportunity to consult with Seller&#146;s attorneys
and other advisors and has availed itself of this right and opportunity; (C) has

it fully explained to it or him by such counsel; (D) is fully aware of the
contents hereof and the meaning, intent and legal effect thereof; and (E) is
competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this Agreement free from
coercion, duress or undue influence. </P>

under this <U>Article VII</U> arising from a claim of a third party (including
any Governmental Authority) (a &#147;<B><I>Third Party Claim</I></B>&#148;), the Parent
must give a Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim to the Seller
promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days) after the Indemnified
Party&#146;s receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, that the
failure to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations except to the extent that the defense of such Third
Party Claim is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice. The Seller will have the right to defend and to direct the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, at its expense and with counsel selected by
the Seller, unless (i) the Seller fails to acknowledge fully to the Parent the
obligations of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within twenty
(20) days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim or contests, in whole
or in part, its indemnification obligations therefor or (ii) at any time while
such Third Party Claim is pending, (A) there is a conflict of interest between
the Seller on behalf of the Indemnifying Party and the Parent on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in the conduct of such defense, (B) the applicable third party
alleges a Fraud Claim or (C) such claim is criminal in nature, could reasonably
be expected to lead to criminal proceedings, or seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. If the Seller on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party elects, and is entitled, to compromise or defend such Third
Party Claim, it will within twenty (20) days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Third Party Claim so requires) notify the Parent of its intent to do so, and the
Parent and the Indemnified Party will, at the request and expense of the Seller,
cooperate in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Seller on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party elects not to, or at any time is not entitled under this
<U>Section 7.4</U> to, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to
notify the Parent of its election as herein provided or refuses to acknowledge
or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Parent on
behalf of the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party will have no indemnification obligations with respect to any
such Third Party Claim which is settled by the Indemnified Party or the Parent
without the prior written consent of the Seller on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party will not be required to refrain from paying any Third Party
Claim which has matured by a final, non-appealable Order, nor will it be
required to refrain from paying any Third Party Claim where the delay in paying
such claim would result in the foreclosure of a Lien upon any of the property or
assets then held by the Indemnified Party or where any delay in payment would
cause the Indemnified Party material economic loss. The Seller&#146;s right on behalf
of the Indemnifying Party to direct the defense will include the right to
compromise or enter into an agreement settling any Third Party Claim;
<U>provided</U>, that no such compromise or settlement will obligate the
Indemnified Party to agree to any settlement that that requires the taking or restriction of
any action (including the payment of money and competition restrictions) by the
Indemnified Party other than the execution of a release for such Third Party
Claim and/or agreeing to be subject to customary confidentiality obligations in
connection therewith, except with the prior written consent of the Parent on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (such consent to be withheld, conditioned or
delayed only for a good faith reason). Notwithstanding the Seller&#146;s right on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party to compromise or settle in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, the Seller on behalf of the Indemnifying Party
may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim over the objection of the
Parent on behalf of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that consent by
the Parent on behalf of the Indemnified Party to settlement or compromise will
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Parent on behalf of
the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Seller&#146;s right on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party to direct the defense. </P>

arising out of, related to, or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (a &#147;<B><I>Dispute</I></B>&#148;) shall be governed
by this <U>Section 11.4</U>. A party must, in the first instance, provide
written notice of any Disputes to the other parties subject to such Dispute,

subject to the Dispute. The parties involved in such Dispute shall seek to
resolve the Dispute on an amicable basis within ten (10) Business Days of the
notice of such Dispute being received by such other parties subject to such
Dispute (the &#147;<B><I>Resolution Period</I></B>&#148;); <U>provided</U>, that if any
Dispute would reasonably be expected to have become moot or otherwise irrelevant
if not decided within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Dispute, then
there shall be no Resolution Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute
that is not resolved during the Resolution Period may immediately be referred to

Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &#147;<B><I>AAA

extent that the AAA Procedures and this Agreement are in conflict, the terms of
this Agreement shall control. The arbitration shall be conducted by one
arbitrator nominated by the AAA promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the submission of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably
acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a
commercial lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes under
acquisition agreements. The arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and
begin the arbitration process promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after his or her nomination and acceptance by the parties subject
to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The
arbitrator shall decide the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of
the state of New York. Time is of the essence. Each party shall submit a
proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days
after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall
have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything
consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law,
including to perform its contractual obligation(s); provided, that the
arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as
applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the proposals. The
arbitrator&#146;s award shall be in writing and shall include a reasonable
explanation of the arbitrator&#146;s reason(s) for selecting one or the other
proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of New
York. The language of the arbitration shall be English. </P>

arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party hereto and (b)

that in any of cases (A) or (B) it shall be a condition to such transfer that
the transferee executes and delivers to the Company an agreement stating that
the transferee is receiving and holding the Exchange Shares subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, and there shall be no further transfer of such
Exchange Shares except in accordance with this Agreement. Each Restricted Holder
further agrees to execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the
Company that are consistent the foregoing or that are necessary to give further

If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the provisions of
this Agreement, such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be null and void ab

of the Exchange Shares as one of its equity holders for any purpose. In order to
enforce this <U>Section 1</U>, the Company may impose stop-transfer instructions
with respect to the Exchange Shares of each Restricted Holder (and permitted
transferees and assigns thereof) until the end of the Lock-Up Period. </P>

<U>Integration and Non-Exclusivity</U>. This Agreement, the Share Exchange
Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents contain the entire agreement between
the Subject Parties and the Covered Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and remedies of the Covered
Parties under this Agreement are not exclusive of or limited by any other rights
or remedies which they may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or
otherwise, all of which will be cumulative (and not alternative). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights and remedies of the Covered
Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of each Subject Party, under this
Agreement, are in addition to their respective rights, remedies, obligations and
liabilities (i) under the laws of unfair competition, misappropriation of trade
secrets, or other requirements of statutory or common law, or any applicable
rules and regulations and (ii) otherwise conferred by contract, including the
Share Exchange Agreement and any other written agreement between a Subject Party
and any of the Covered Parties. Nothing in the Share Exchange Agreement will
limit any of the obligations, liabilities, rights or remedies of the Subject
Parties or the Covered Parties under this Agreement, nor will any breach of the
Share Exchange Agreement or any other agreement between any Subject Party and
any of the Covered Parties limit or otherwise affect any right or remedy of the
Covered Parties under this Agreement. If any term or condition of any other

<U>Severability; Reformation</U>. Each provision of this Agreement is separable
from every other provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement
is found or held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
by a court of competent jurisdiction, then (i) such provision will be deemed
amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid, legal and enforceable
to the fullest possible extent, (ii) the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of such provision will not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision under any other circumstances or in any other
jurisdiction, and (iii) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of such
provision will not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the
remainder of such provision or the validity, legality or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement. The Subject Parties and the Covered Parties
will substitute for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable
and equitable provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision. Without limiting the foregoing, if any court of competent
jurisdiction determines that any part hereof is unenforceable because of the
duration, geographic area covered, scope of such provision, or otherwise, such
court will have the power to reduce the duration, geographic area covered or
scope of such provision, as the case may be, and, in its reduced form, such

No waiver will be effective unless it is expressly set forth in a written
instrument executed by the waiving party and any such waiver will have no effect
except in the specific instance in which it is given. Any delay or omission by a
party in exercising its rights under this Agreement, or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with any term, covenant, or condition of this Agreement will
not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, condition or right, nor will any
waiver or relinquishment of any right or power under this Agreement at any time
or times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any
other time or times. </P>

<U>Dispute Resolution</U>. Any dispute, difference, controversy or claim arising
in connection with or related or incidental to, or question occurring under,
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof (other than applications for a

Any Dispute that is not resolved may at any time after the delivery of such
notice immediately be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant
to the then-existing Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules
(the &#147;<B><I>AAA Procedures</I></B>&#148;) of the American Arbitration Association
(the &#147;<B><I>AAA</I></B>&#148;). Any party involved in such Dispute may submit the
Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after the Resolution Period. To
the extent that the AAA Procedures and this Agreement are in conflict, the terms
of this Agreement shall control. The arbitration shall be conducted by one
arbitrator nominated by the AAA promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the submission of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably
acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a
commercial lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes under
acquisition agreements. The arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and
begin the arbitration process promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after his or her nomination and acceptance by the parties subject
to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The
arbitrator shall decide the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of
the State of New York. Time is of the essence. Each party shall submit a
proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days
after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall
have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything
consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law,
including to perform its contractual obligation(s); <U>provided</U>, that the
arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as
applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the proposals. The
arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a reasonable
explanation of the arbitrator's reason(s) for selecting one or the other
proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of New
York. The language of the arbitration shall be English. </P>
