<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 30, 2017, American Lorain Corporation (the
&#147;Company&#148;) filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(&#147;SEC&#148;) indicating that the Company was delaying the filing of its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. As previously disclosed in
the Form 12b-25, the Company could not complete the filing of its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2016, due to a delay in obtaining
and compiling information required to be included in the Company's Form 10-K,
which delay could not be eliminated by the Company without unreasonable effort
and expense. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 18, 2017, the Company received a letter
from NYSE MKT LLC (the &#147;Exchange&#148;) stating that the Exchange has determined that
the Company is not in compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT
Company Guide (the &#147;Company Guide&#148;) due to the Company&#146;s failure to timely file
with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016. The letter also states that the Company&#146;s failure to timely file its
Annual Report on Form 10-K is a material violation of its listing agreement with
the Exchange and, therefore, pursuant to Section 1003(d) of the Company Guide,
the Exchange is authorized to suspend and, unless prompt corrective action is
taken, remove the Company&#146;s securities from the Exchange. The Exchange has
informed the Company that, in order to maintain its listing on the Exchange, the
Company must, by May 18, 2017, submit a plan of compliance (the &#147;Plan&#148;) advising
the Exchange of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with
Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide by October 18, 2017 (the &#147;Plan
Period&#148;). If the Plan is accepted by the Exchange, then the Company will be able
to continue its listing during the Plan Period, during which time it will be
subject to periodic monitoring for compliance with the Plan. If the Company does
not submit a Plan or the Company&#146;s Plan is not accepted by the Exchange, then
the Company will be subject to delisting proceedings. Furthermore, if the Plan
is accepted by the Exchange, but the Company is not in compliance with the
continued listing standards of the Company Guide by October 18, 2017, or if the
Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan Period,
then the Exchange staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 24, 2017, the Company issued a press a release
stating that it had received the letter from the Exchange.</P>
