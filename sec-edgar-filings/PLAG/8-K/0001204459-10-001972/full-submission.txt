Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to American Lorain&#146;s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  We had a very good quarter for these three months ended June 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2010. And we have seen the results of our new strategy,

We continue to expand our distribution network, much as in China, but also in markets outside of the country.  We have made very good progress.  We have been negotiating with distributors in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and the

Actually we&#146;ve had a very exciting third and fourth quarter. And I believe the sales of our chestnut products, as well as the bean product, Lunch Box products, and the cold dish products will contribute significant increase in

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Thank you, Mr. Chen.  Now before I go into the financial review of our second quarter earnings, and the six months performance in 2010, I would like to provide a brief overview of our business for new or prospective shareholders on this call.</P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 American Lorain is based in Shandong Province in the town of Junan of China.  American Lorain Corporation develops, manufacturers, and sells various food products, which include a Lorain brand and chestnut product, convenience food products, and
frozen food. </P>

<A name="page_3"></A>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 We currently sell over 230 products in 26 provinces and administrative regions in China, as well as to 42 foreign countries. Our sales and distribution network is comprised of direct sales team, agents, distributors, and dealers who service more
than 5,200 retail points throughout China. These retail locations include well known global food retailers like Wal-Mart and Carrefour&reg;, convenience store chains like 7-11 and Watson, and dozens of large to medium size Chinese food retail chains
throughout China.  We operate through four direct and indirect subsidiaries and one leased factory located in China. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 I would like to start out by summarizing our performance in the second quarter of 2010.</P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 For the quarter ended June 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2010, our revenue was &#36;29.2 million, up 21.9% from the second quarter of 2009, with our convenience food sales improving 62.6% year-over-year. Our gross profit was &#36;6.7 million, up 27% from the
second quarter of 2009, with gross margin of 23%, a 90 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2009.  Operating income margin was 15.7% for the quarter, a 255 basis point improvement over 2009.  Our net income was &#36;2.7 million, up
44.4% from the second quarter of 2009, with earnings per diluted share of &#36;0.10 based on 26.8 million shares. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Our revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was &#36;29.2 million, up 21.9% from &#36;24 million for the quarter ended June 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2009. The increase was primarily due to a higher sales contribution from our convenience food segments,
which grew by 62.6% quarter-over-quarter. In the second quarter of 2010 our revenues from convenience food products were 35.1% of total revenue for the quarter, an increase from 28.9% over the first quarter of 2010. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Products in the American Lorain&#146;s convenience food product line included ready to eat meals, and the snack foods, ready to heat Lunch Box entrees, and the self heating meals for military personnel. We have developed and launched more than 100
convenience type foods in the Chinese markets, and are leveraging our longstanding distributor in the retail networks from our chestnut business to introduce the Lorain brand in the convenience food to our 5,200 retail points in 26 provinces in
China. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 We introduced to the market two new products in the convenience food category around the end of 2009, and have been promoting these products through our distribution network in China.  These products are bean products, Lunch Box products, and cold
dish products.  The revenue generated from these products during the second quarter was &#36;3.4 million, &#36;0.7 million, and &#36;1.9 million for bean, Lunch Box, and the cold dish products respectively. </P>

<HR noshade align="center" width="100%" size=5 color="black" style="page-break-after:always;">



<!--$$/page=-->
<A name="page_4"></A>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 We will continue to promote new products, which we believe will be the key revenue driver for the company in the future, and will work with agents and the distributors to build our distribution network in China.  We currently work with over 300
Chinese distributors.  Working with these distributors allows us to expand into new marketplace more efficiently and effectively.  It also helps us cut down our receivables and incur our cash positions.</P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Chestnut is our core product line, includes more than 50 varieties of different chestnuts, and chestnut-based snack foods. Sales in this category increased 7.3% from the second quarter of 2009, and met our expectations for the quarter.  Our
chestnut business accounted for 51% of the Company&#146;s revenues, and is derived from a combination of domestic and international sales of chestnut and chestnut-based snack foods.  Our sales in China accounted for 75.4% of chestnut sales, and our
export market accounted for the balance of the revenues in which Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom remained our largest export markets. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Our frozen foods are sold in bulk to commercial customers in export markets, and the quick service restaurant chains like KFC and the Pizza Hut restaurant in China. Sales on frozen foods, including frozen vegetables and certain frozen foods
accounted for about 14% of revenue in the second quarter of 2010.  American Lorain only serviced a select group of commercial accounts, and we are not actively growing this business segment due to its lower margin profile. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Our gross profits for the second quarter of 2010 were &#36;6.7 million, a 27% increase from &#36;5.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, as a result of an increase in revenue.  Overall gross profit margin was 23% for the second quarter, compared
to 22.1% for the second quarter of 2009, as sales of higher margin chestnut and convenience foods accounting for a higher percentage of revenue in the quarter. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Historically, our gross margins for each product category fall into these ranges: chestnut, the average gross margin ranges from 25 to 28%; convenience food products 22 to 24%; and the frozen food product 15 to 18%. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Operating income for the quarter increased by 45.5% to &#36;4.6 million, with operating margin of 15.7% versus the &#36;3.2 million and operating margins of 13.2% recorded in the second quarter of 2009. Our sales and marketing expense, and the
general and administrative expense remain flat quarter-over-quarter at approximately &#36;2.1 million.  Net income for the quarter was &#36;2.7 million, an increase of 44.4% from &#36;1.9 million in the same period in 2009. </P>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Based on 20.75 million fully diluted shares outstanding, earnings per diluted share were &#36;0.10 per share, a 35.9% increase over the prior year. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Now on to our six months results.  Our revenue for the six months of&#151;for the first six months of 2010 was &#36;53.8 million, a 19.1% increase from &#36;45.2 million in the prior year&#146;s period. For the first six months in 2010 domestic
sales accounted for 81.2% of total revenue, while international sales accounted for 18.8%, with Japan and South Korea, two of our key export markets where we primarily sell Chestnut, contributing 7.9% and the 4.5% of total sales respectively. A
trend of increased domestic revenue is consistent with the Company&#146;s strategy to gain market share with Chinese consumers. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Among the total revenue, Chestnut contributed &#36;27.8 million, which is a 4.8% increase, compared with &#36;26.5 million in the same period of 2009.  Convenience food products contributed &#36;17.4 million, or a 136% increase over &#36;7.3
million in the same period of 2009.  Frozen food had &#36;8.6 million, that was about a 24% decrease from &#36;11.3 million in the same period of 2009. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Our gross profit in the first half of fiscal year 2010 was &#36;12.4 million, an increase of 19% from &#36;10.5 million in the prior year&#146;s corresponding period. And our gross profit margins remained constant at 26.1% for the six months ended
June 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2010. Operating income in the first half of 2010 was &#36;8 million, with operating margin of 14.7%, which represented a 28.5% dollar increase from &#36;6.2 million in the prior year&#146;s period. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Our net income for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was &#36;4.5 million, compared to &#36;3.6 million in 2009, which is a 25.7% increase year-over-year.  Our earnings per weighted average diluted share was &#36;0.17 based on 26.75 million
diluted shares. Based on our view of the second half of the year, we expect we will meet our guidance of 182 to &#36;190 million in revenue, and 17.8 to &#36;19 million in net income. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 Our business still has a seasonal pattern due to the heavy weight Chestnut product line has in total value. The next two quarters will be very busy for the company as chestnut harvest season begins. We expect the revenue generated from Chestnut and
the convenience food industry to increase significantly in the second half of the year. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 As of June 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2010 we had &#36;10.3 million in cash, down slightly by &#36;1.8 million compared to that of December 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2009.  Our working capital was &#36;45.5 million on June 30<SUP>th</SUP>, 2010, and accounts

 The capital expenditures for the first six months of 2010 was approximately &#36;10 million, which was spent on the new convenience food production lines, and the frozen storage at our facilities in Shandong and Dongguan.  With our strong cash flow

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
First, Chairman said these three key products, the bean products, Lunch Box products, as well as cold dish products are the key products to drive the future revenue growth of the company. And so far look at the performance of these
three products in the first six months of 2010.  The most, and the revenue generated was slightly lower than we expected, due to various market conditions, especially the sudden rise in the price of raw material of beans.  Look at our numbers for
the second quarter.  We had about &#36;60 million generated from these three products. And the Chairman is very confident that when we enter into the second half of 2010, we will definitely see a higher growth in these three products, and especially
in the fourth quarter. The results coming out of the sales of these three products will be very exciting. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Joe Giamichael:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
And Alan, I just&#151;I know that you&#146;ve, you know, expanded the bean capacity, as well as I guess shifted some of the utilization around for your other facilities.  Where do you stand in regard to your facility
utilization rates now?  And I know that you said you had no cap ex plans for balance of 2010, but I guess more generally, sort of where and when would you expect to add capacity? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
The Company (unintelligible).  And in Q1 and Q2, which is historically relatively lighter season, a utilization of the existing capacity is somewhere between 40 to 50%. And we expect that our utilization rates will increase
significantly when the chestnut season begins in Q3, and reaches the peak in Q4. With the addition of the new bean production lines, as well as the multi-purpose convenience food production lines in our Shandong facility, we expect that at least for
2010 we don&#146;t need to add any more capacity to meet the growing demand of our products. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 We increased some capital expenditure in Q2, mostly to build a frozen storage for our Dongwon facility, which is primarily focusing on the cold dish products. The cold dish products have very short shelf life, and for the Dongwon facility, that
gets it from the other facility which is located close to raw material.  That particular facility is located to the market.  So we think it&#146;s safer to have our own frozen storage rather than lease external storage.  But having said that, it
doesn&#146;t change the company&#146;s strategy to leased additional production lines in the future if there&#146;s a need to expand further our production capacity. So we don&#146;t expect we will increase our investment as expected in the second
half of 2010. In the current capacity, especially with the new addition of capacity until (unintelligible) the growing demand of our products. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Joe Giamichael:</B> </P>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay, great. And then just one last question and I&#146;ll get out of the way. Can you give us an update on the Kimchi acquisition, and
then just talk a little bit about what that would potentially add in terms of distribution and/or just sort of new points of sale? </P>

<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
We expect to complete that acquisition of the Kimchi facility before the end of September. And the instant benefits of this acquisition is the addition of the production capacity on the Korean type of Kimchi products. It should be
very nice addition to the current cold dish product category that we have. And that company has also built up a very extensive distribution network outside of China, in Japan and the Korea, which is a nice addition to the existing chestnut
distribution network that we have.  We will fully utilize the production capacity and the leverage on our existing domestic distribution network to start selling Kimchi products, as well as export the products and leverage on its existing
distribution network in Japan and the South Korea. </P>

Hi, Alan. (Chinese spoken). Okay, my first question is about the revenue side. For the first two quarters of this year you improved the revenue by 19% year-over-year. And obviously you had&#151;you achieved 25% of full year growth,
you probably have some catch up to do in the second half. I just wondered what, for each product line, chestnut, convenience food, and the frozen food, what do you see the growth projection in the second half of the year? </P>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay.  So just for the benefit of the rest of the audience, Chairman answered Echo&#146;s previous question, which is that obviously the company is allocating more resources to the higher margin convenience food and chestnut
products. But we do receive large orders on the frozen products from time to time, and actually for the second half of the year there may be a large order for each of these categories that we may receive. And if that actually happens, we may see a
growth in the frozen category. But that doesn&#146;t change our strategy to focus more of our resources on the higher margin chestnut and convenience food business. And to answer Echo&#146;s second question, whether the Companies do expect a 15 to
20% growth in the chestnut category for 2010, Chairman said yes. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Echo He:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay. Thank you for that. Just&#151;Alan, you just said in your prepared remark that in Lunch Box and cold dishes contribute like 3.7 million for the bean, and the rest of them, the contribution&#151;that dollar sales, I didn&#146;t
get it. And also&#151; </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay. That&#146;s&#151;let me just repeat the numbers. And during the second quarter for the bean products revenue was &#36;3.4 million. For the Lunch Box products, that&#146;s &#36;.7 million. And for the cold dish products,
that&#146;s &#36;1.9 million. So add up total these three new type of products contribute about &#36;6 million in the second quarter of 2010. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Echo He:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
So what&#151;how compared to last quarter? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Compared with Q1, the bean products had &#36;2.4 million in Q1 of 2010. So we are looking at 42% growth in Q2 compared with Q1. And Lunch Box products had about &#36;0.15 million in Q1. So we had about 400% growth in Q2, which was
&#36;0.7 million revenue realized from the Lunch Box products. And for the cold dish products in Q1 the revenue was &#36;1.5 million. We are looking at about 30% increase in revenue in Q2 from the cold dish products. Add up total, in Q1 these new
products had about &#36;4 million in revenue. </P>

Our products are already selling in over 600 supermarkets in Japan. The market has developed, and the exports from China to Japan is more and more accepted and welcomed by Japanese consumers because of the quality of the product, as well as the

Hi, good morning.  Well most of my questions have been asked, so I only have one more. So one is the chestnuts, which Alan you mentioned is 70&#151;so 75.4% of the chestnut sales were domestic. What was this number in 1Q 2010? And
same period last year, which is 2Q 2009? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>

I remember the percentage was rather lower, but I need to check the documents, Joy. On that particular number I can get back to you later. </P>

Great.  And then secondly, for the short-term cash that you had on the balance sheet, you know, last quarter that remains, you know, on the balance sheet, you know, this quarter, can it be converted to working capital at some point?

Okay.  Because the deal is not completed yet, the Chairman&#146;s said, it is too early to give an update on the revenue impact from this acquisition. But he&#146;s certainly confident that the revenue contribution from this
acquisition should be meaningful, and justify this corporate action when we look at the revenue realized in 2011. He will do some work and let me get back to you, Joy, if you need the exact expectation from him on the revenue impact. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Joy Wang:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay, great. And so a quick follow-up is do we have a gross&#151;an average gross margin number for the Kimchi product? </P>

Korean Kimchi average gross margin of the domestic sales will be around 40%. It is one of those high margin products. Its export to Japan is around 30%. Its export to Korea is around 10%. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Joy Wang:</B> </P>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay, great. And then finally my last question, which is more of a qualitative one. Regarding the expansion and convenience sales, what kind of overlap or, you know, synergies are we seeing in the distribution channels, you know,
relative to&#151;is there any overlap in distribution with chestnuts?  And also, you know, because you&#146;ve, you know, ramped up, you know, over the years on the chestnut, you know, products, you know, pretty successfully, you know, what
learnings can you apply, whether it&#146;s in, you know, product mix, or distribution, you know, that you can apply to the convenience food channel? Thanks. </P>

<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Joy, you are talking about the general convenience store? Or you are particularly talking about the acquisition Greenpia? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Joy Wang:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Here, I&#146;ll narrow it down to, you know, what sort of overlap in distribution channel are you seeing between convenience foods and chestnut products? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
We launched the convenience food category back to 2004.  And one of the successes we achieved is the knowledge in existing distribution networks that we built up from the chestnut business to quickly promote and sell our convenience
food products.  So we don&#146;t really have a separate distribution network for our convenience foods alone. So basically we have this extensive domestic distribution network built up from chestnuts that now applies to the sales of chestnuts and
convenience foods, as well as our other products as well. </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Joy Wang:</B></P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
Okay, great. Are you able to get, you know, a little bit more negotiation power with your distributors, because now you have, you know, a broader array of products, you know, being supplied to them? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
It&#146;s more of the brand equities that we have of our products.  Historically it is easier for us to negotiate our chestnut products because it&#146;s established a reputation in the brand equity, maybe a little bit more
difficult for the new products that we introduce to the market. That is why the Chairman is very keen on the continuous buildup of our brand recognition in the market.  And also when we choose the distributor or agent to work with, we particularly
work with those small or medium size distributors so that the Company may have advantage in negotiation. For those very large distributors that particularly cover one or multiple provinces, they are very powerful. So the advantage may not be on the
company&#146;s side, and we may have difficulty in negotiating a good term for ourselves when doing business with them. </P>

Okay. One more question, this is regarding the cost of revenue. We see a significant increase right in the cost of revenue year-on-year that is coming around 20.4 percentage. How much of this can we attribute to the rise in
raw material cost? And do you have any specific hedging plans in place? </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Alan Jin:</B> </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%; margin-top: -25.5pt">
We don&#146;t typically hedge the raw material, first because there&#146;s no such product available in the market that we can purchase to hedge the price for raw chestnuts. And most of the cost of revenue is the raw material.
Usually that&#146;s over 80%. We don&#146;t typically hedge, and currently we don&#146;t have any plans to hedge in the future. </P>

Okay.  The Chairman says the progress with 7-11, our Lunch Box sales, actually it&#146;s lower than expected. We haven&#146;t really got our Lunch Box products on sale on shelves. But currently what we sell to the stores are those
Japanese type of shabu shabu products that you see in these Chinese food counter inside of 7-11 stores.  They cook it right inside the store (unintelligible) other products from us.  But we packaged the Lunch Box, we haven&#146;t got on to the

Yes we are still talking to them. Because 7-11 has a very strict process, and they&#151;normally they move very slow.  Typically if you walk into a 7-11 store, you look at their shelves, the package, the food, similar Lunch Box
products, those brands that have seen in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong area for a very long time. Particularly what you will see probably is the Si Hai Yu Dan which is a local brand in Hong Kong and in Guangzhou for many years. Plus we are a new

The Chairman expects raw bean price will decrease significantly on the rest of 2010 because beans had a very good harvest. So the supply is sufficient to expect the price will drop significantly.  However, on chestnuts we expect the
price will go up, because the chestnuts actually expect less availability in the market.  So we do have less chestnut available in the market for 2010. As a result the price will go up. </P>

There are basically three things we did to promote the sales of our Lunch Box products. First is to add more variety into the Lunch Box category so that consumers will have more choice. That will definitely help on the sales of the
product.  And two is to reach more retail points in existing markets we are in so that more consumers will see and try our product. That will help on the sales as well. And the third thing we did is to enter into new markets where we have never been

Chairman said he agrees with you that he also believes this is a fantastic product.  One thing that he believes delayed the process is that when we enter into new markets and discuss with new supermarket chains or a distributor,
oftentimes they charge more on a new product like Lunch Box.  So that makes the whole negotiation more difficult. Otherwise, he believes that a promotional goal will deliver much better results. </P>

Guys, congratulations on the quarter.  Obviously you&#146;ve been in the chestnut business for a long time. I was just curious how far in advance are you able to secure your supply of chestnuts?  It was just discussed that the
price might be going up because of the harvest might be a little small this year. I was just wondering, you know, if you can secure a supply pretty far in advance? Or do you have to just kind of go in there and slug it out when the, you know, when
the harvest gets closer? </P>

The Chairman mentioned a couple of things.  First, that we are very well informed of the raw material price movements. And also we
have enough facilities, typically the frozen storage facilities to keep those chestnuts that we are going to purchase. And also we already make available lots of capital, lots of cash so that we can go out very quickly to farmers and buy the
chestnuts. And, you know, just want to give you a background introduction. American Lorain has four of its manufacturing facilities in China that were strategically located close to raw material. We have two facilities in Shandong, which is one of
the major chestnut tree areas in China, and one in Beijing which is another chestnut tree area, and one in Luotian, that&#146;s the third major chestnut tree area. </P>

<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 So 15 years ago we started building our facilities there so that our people and the manufacturing facilities can stay very close to the chestnut trees and to those farmers. And for many farmers that are still our supplier today, we have been
working with them for over a decade, and established a very solid relationship. The market practice does not allow long-term contracts, so we cannot secure a three or five year supply contract.  But because we stay close to them and we work with
them year over year, and when we grow in size these suppliers just cannot afford losing us as their biggest customer. </P>
<P align="justify" style="text-indent: 15%">
 And oftentimes when new players enter into the business they start planting chestnut trees.  We give them technical guidance. We help them to plant chestnut trees, and we secure that once they can harvest from the tree they plant that they have
somebody to sell the chestnuts. So that relationship we build with farmers is very solid. And we never had any problem in securing the supply from these farmers. </P>
