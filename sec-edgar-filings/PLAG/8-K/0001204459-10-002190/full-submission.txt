<P align=justify><B>Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
</B></P>
<P align=justify><I>Securities Purchase Agreement</I> </P>
<P align=justify>American Lorain Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Mr. Si Chen
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 9, 2010 (the
&#147;Securities Purchase Agreement&#148;) with the Purchasers identified therein (the
&#147;Purchasers&#148;) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Purchasers
3,440,800 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the
&#147;Securities&#148;). The shares of common stock are priced at $2.80 per share, for an
aggregate gross purchase price of approximately $9.6 million. The transaction is
being effected as a private placement under applicable securities laws. </P>
<P align=justify>The transaction closed on September 10, 2010. Giving effect to
the closing, the Purchasers own approximately 10.2% of the Company&#146;s issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, subject to increase pursuant to the Make
Whole Guarantee described below. </P>
<P align=justify>In connection with this transaction, the Company was obligated
to pay Rodman &amp; Renshaw, LLC, as lead placement agent, and FT Global Inc.,
as co-agent, in the aggregate, a commission equal to 5% on the purchase price
paid by the Lead Purchaser (as defined below) and 4% on the aggregate purchase
price paid by the other Purchasers. </P>
<P align=justify>The Securities Purchase Agreement contains customary
representations, warranties, and agreements by the Company and customary
conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and of the
Purchasers, including for liability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and other obligations of the parties. In this regard, the
Company will be listing the Securities with the NYSE Amex. The Securities
Purchase Agreement also provides that, prior to January 1, 2012, the Company
shall not issue any equity securities or equity-linked securities at a price per
share that is below the $2.80 per share price without the prior written consent
of Purchasers holding a majority in interest of the Securities. The Purchasers
also agreed to negotiate in good faith with the Make Good Pledgor (as defined
below) regarding the transfer of additional shares (the &#147;Consent Shares&#148;) of
common stock from the Make Good Pledgor to the Purchasers on a pro rata basis as
consideration for such requisite number of Purchasers providing any such
consent, subject however to consent of the Company&#146;s stockholders as described
below. </P>
<P align=justify>Five of the Purchasers previously entered into a securities
purchase agreement with the Company, dated as of October 28, 2009 (the &#147;October
Purchase Agreement&#148;), as described in the Company&#146;s Current Report on Form 8-K,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) on October 29,
2009 and which is hereby incorporated by reference. In order to participate in
the current transaction, the five Purchasers exercised their right, pursuant to
the October Purchase Agreement, to participate in up to 25%, in the aggregate,
of future financing transactions conducted by the Company.</P>
<P align=justify>The October Purchase Agreement also provided for the issuance
of Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants (together, the &#147;Warrants&#148;). The
initial exercise price of each of the Warrants was $3.70 per share. As required
under the adjustment provisions of the Warrants in the event of certain future
financing transactions, the exercise price of each of the Warrants has been
adjusted to $3.00 per share as a result of the transactions contemplated
by the Securities Purchase Agreement.</P>

<P align=justify>The foregoing description of the Securities Purchase Agreement
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the Securities Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Make Whole Guarantee </I></P>
<P align=justify>Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company and
Mr. Si Chen, currently the Company&#146;s largest stockholder, Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and President of the Company (the &#147;Make Good Pledgor&#148;) entered
into a Make Good Escrow Agreement, dated as of September 9, 2010 (the &#147;Make Good
Agreement&#148;), with the Purchasers and Collateral Agents, LLC, as escrow agent
(&#147;Escrow Agent&#148;). Pursuant to the Make Good Agreement, the Make Good Pledgor
agreed to transfer to the Purchasers additional shares of common stock owned by
him in the event the Company fails to satisfy certain earnings per share targets
in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As described in the Make Good Agreement, in the event
that the Company&#146;s earnings per share, as calculated therein, is less than $0.55
for the year ending December 31, 2010 or grows annually by less than 125% for
the year ended December 31, 2011 or by less than 120% for the year ended
December 31, 2012, the Purchasers are entitled to receive from the Make Good
Pledgor (subject to approval of the Company&#146;s stockholders) additional shares in
amounts as calculated under the formulas described therein to make up for the
shortfall. If the 2011 earnings per share target is not achieved, the Company
and the Make Good Pledgor have the option to defer until 2012 the obligation to
deliver additional shares in respect of the 2011 shortfall in order to have the
opportunity to satisfy the 2011 shortfall amount in 2012. </P>
<P align=justify>Pursuant to the Make Good Agreement, the Make Good Pledgor has
agreed to place 1,300,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock owned by him
(&#147;Escrow Shares&#148;) in escrow to satisfy the foregoing obligation. 1,000,000 of
the Escrow Shares (as equitably adjusted for any stock split, stock combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction) are allocated exclusively to Tongley
Investment Ltd. (the &#147;Lead Purchaser&#148;) and the remaining 300,000 Escrow Shares
(as equitably adjusted for any stock split, stock combination, recapitalization
or similar transaction) are allocated exclusively to the Purchasers other than
the Lead Purchaser. In addition, the Make Good Pledgor has agreed to reserve an
additional 3 million shares of his Company common stock to satisfy earnings per
share shortfalls in 2010, 2011 and 2012 in excess of shortfalls covered by the
Escrow Shares. The delivery of such additional shares, the Consent Shares
discussed above, and any other shares the Make Good Pledgor may be obligated to
deliver, when taken together with the 3,440,800 shares sold in the private
placement, in excess of an aggregate of 19.9% of the Company&#146;s outstanding
shares are, as required by NYSE Amex listing requirements, subject to approval
by the Company&#146;s stockholders at the Company&#146;s next annual meeting. The Company
has agreed to seek such stockholder approval, and the Make Good Pledgor, who
owns more than a majority of the Company&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock,
has agreed to vote in favor of this proposal, thus assuring its approval.</P>
<P align=justify>The foregoing description of the Make Good Agreement does not

Good Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto. </P>

<P align=justify><I>Registration Rights Agreement </I></P>
<P align=justify>Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company also
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of September 9, 2010 (the
&#147;Registration Rights Agreement&#148;), with the Purchasers. Pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to prepare and file a
registration statement covering the resale of the Securities with the SEC. In
addition, the Company agreed to prepare and file registration statements
covering the resale of the Escrow Shares issued to the Purchasers, if any, with
the SEC. The Company shall cause the registration statements to be filed by the
30<SUP>th</SUP> day following the closing of the transaction with respect to the
Securities and the 30<SUP>th</SUP> day following the delivery of the Escrow
Shares, as applicable, and use commercially reasonable efforts to have the
registration statements declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as
possible thereafter, but in any event prior to the 150<SUP>th</SUP> day
following the closing date with respect to the Securities or the
150<SUP>th</SUP> day following the delivery of the Escrow Shares, as applicable.

Registration Rights Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Stockholder Agreement </I></P>
<P align=justify>Additionally, pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement,
the Company entered into a Stockholder Agreement, dated as of September 9, 2010
(the &#147;Stockholder Agreement&#148;), with the Make Good Pledgor and the Purchasers.
The Stockholder Agreement terminates, subject to certain restrictions, upon the
Purchasers no longer beneficially owning at least 20% of their shares acquired
under the Securities Purchase Agreement. </P>
<P align=justify>Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, the Make Good Pledgor
must provide notice to the Purchasers of the terms of any proposed transfer of
securities (subject to certain exceptions) and the Purchasers shall have the
first option to purchase their pro rata portion of the Make Good Pledgor&#146;s
securities at a purchase price equal to the price quoted in the notice.
Additionally, if the Make Good Pledgor seeks to transfer more than 1,000,000
shares of common stock owned by him, the Purchasers have the right to sell their
pro rata portion of up to half of the total amount of shares proposed to be sold
by the Make Good Pledgor. Additionally, if the Make Good Pledgor seeks to
transfer more than 30% of his shares owned as of September 9, 2010, the
Purchasers will have the right to sell all of their shares on the same terms and
conditions and at the same price per share and to the same transferee to whom
the Make Good Pledgor proposes to sell his stock. Additionally, as long as the
Purchasers own more than 20% of the shares acquired under the Securities
Purchase Agreement, the Make Good Pledgor shall not effect any transaction that
would directly cause him not to be the largest stockholder, and he shall remain
Chief Executive Officer of the Company.</P>
<P align=justify>The foregoing description of the Stockholder Agreement does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Stockholder Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.4 hereto. </P>

$50,000 (other than trade accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of
business), (y) all guaranties, endorsements and other contingent obligations in
respect of indebtedness of others, whether or not the same are or should be
reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto),
except guaranties by endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or

the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party agrees that all legal
proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents
(whether brought against a party hereto or its respective affiliates, directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees or agents) shall be
commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New
York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan
for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with
any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect
to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that
such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such
proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and
consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by
mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery
(with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices
to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good
and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law. If either party shall commence an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce any provisions of the Transaction Documents, then, in addition to the obligations of the Company under Section 4.9,
the prevailing party in such action, suit or proceeding shall be reimbursed by
the other party for its reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and other costs and expenses
incurred with the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding.</P>

any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction
Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall
be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint
venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers
are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations
or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser
shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights including,
without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other
Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to
be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each
Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review
and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative
convenience only, each Purchaser and its respective counsel have chosen to
communicate with the Company through WS. WS does not represent any of the
Purchasers and only represents Rodman &amp; Renshaw, LLC. The Company has
elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents
for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested
to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that
each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other Transaction

Company and the Purchasers collectively and not between and among the

of the Transaction Documents or any amendments thereto. In addition, each and every reference to

relevant date), and that the right to receive any Make Good Shares is personal

Annual Report, or 2012 Annual Report, in each case calculated in accordance with
this Make Good Agreement, is equal to or greater than the 2010 Guaranteed EPS,

filing of the Company&#146;s Annual Report on 10-K for fiscal year 2010, 2011, or
2012, as applicable, provide such instructions to the Transfer Agent of the

directed by the Company to give such re-issuance instruction to the Transfer
Agent of the Company. If any Escrow Shares remain in escrow following required

receives a communication requiring the conversion of the Escrow Shares to cash
or the exchange of the Escrow Shares for that of an acquiring company, the
Escrow Agent shall solicit and follow the written instructions of the Make Good
Pledgor; provided, that the cash or exchanged shares are instructed to be
redeposited into the Escrow Account. Make Good Pledgor shall be responsible for
all taxes resulting from any such conversion or exchange.</P>
<P align=justify>Assuming the Make Good Pledgor provides good and valid title to
the Escrow Shares to be transferred and delivered on behalf of the Make Good
Pledgor to the Purchasers hereunder, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances,
equities or claims, the Escrow Agent will ensure that upon delivery of the
Escrow Shares, good and valid title to the Escrow Shares, free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances, equities or claims will pass to the Purchasers. The Escrow
Agent shall not take any action which could impair Purchasers&#146;s rights in the
Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent shall not sell, transfer, assign or otherwise
dispose of (by operation of law or otherwise) or grant any option with respect
to any Escrow Shares prior to the termination of this Agreement.</P>
<P align=justify><B>7. Interpleader. </B>Should any controversy arise among the
parties hereto with respect to this Make Good Agreement or with respect to the
right to receive the Escrow Shares, Escrow Agent and/or the Purchasers shall
have the right to consult and hire counsel and/or to institute an appropriate
interpleader action to determine the rights of the parties. Escrow Agent is also
hereby authorized to institute an appropriate interpleader action upon receipt
of a written letter of direction executed by the parties so directing Escrow
Agent. If Escrow Agent is directed to institute an appropriate interpleader
action, it shall institute such action not prior to thirty (30) days after
receipt of such letter of direction and not later than sixty (60) days after
such date. Any interpleader action instituted in accordance with this Section 7
shall be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York,
and the Escrow Shares in dispute shall be deposited with the court and in such
event Escrow Agent shall be relieved of and discharged from any and all
obligations and liabilities under and pursuant to this Make Good Agreement with
respect to the Escrow Shares and any other obligations hereunder. </P>

<P align=justify><B>8. Exculpation and Indemnification of Escrow Agent. </B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Escrow Agent is not a party
to, and is not bound by or charged with notice of any agreement out of which
this escrow may arise. Escrow Agent acts under this Make Good Agreement as a
depositary only and is not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for
the sufficiency, correctness, genuineness or validity of the subject matter of
the escrow, or any part thereof, or for the form or execution of any notice
given by any other party hereunder, or for the identity or authority of any
person executing any such notice. Escrow Agent will have no duties or
responsibilities other than those expressly set forth herein. Escrow Agent will
be under no liability to anyone by reason of any failure on the part of any
party hereto (other than Escrow Agent) or any maker, endorser or other signatory
of any document to perform such person's or entity's obligations hereunder or
under any such document. Except for this Make Good Agreement and instructions to
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this Make Good Agreement, Escrow Agent
will not be obligated to recognize any agreement between or among any or all of
the persons or entities referred to herein, notwithstanding its knowledge
thereof.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Escrow Agent will not be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it, or any action suffered by it to be
taken or omitted, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct. Escrow Agent
may rely conclusively on, and will be protected in acting upon, any order,
notice, demand, certificate, or opinion or advice of counsel (including counsel
chosen by Escrow Agent), statement, instrument, report or other paper or
document (not only as to its due execution and the validity and effectiveness of
its provisions, but also as to the truth and acceptability of any information
therein contained) which is reasonably believed by Escrow Agent to be genuine
and to be signed or presented by the proper person or persons. The duties and
responsibilities of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of this Make Good Agreement and no other or further duties or
responsibilities shall be implied, including, but not limited to, any obligation
under or imposed by any laws of the State of New York upon fiduciaries. THE
ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES,
LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN
DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE DIRECTLY
RESULTED FROM THE ESCROW AGENT&#146;S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II)
SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR
DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Company and Make Good
Pledgor each hereby, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each of
Escrow Agent and any of their principals, partners, agents, employees and
affiliates from and against any expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements, damages or losses suffered by Escrow Agent in connection with
any claim or demand, which, in any way, directly or indirectly, arises out of or
relates to this Make Good Agreement or the services of Escrow Agent hereunder;
except, that if Escrow Agent is guilty of willful misconduct or gross negligence
under this Make Good Agreement, then Escrow Agent will bear all losses, damages
and expenses arising as a result of its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence. Promptly after the receipt by Escrow Agent of notice of any such
demand or claim or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating
to such demand or claim, Escrow Agent will notify the other parties hereto in
writing. For the purposes hereof, the terms "expense" and "loss" will include
all amounts paid or payable to satisfy any such claim or demand, or in
settlement of any such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding settled with
the express written consent of the parties hereto, and all costs and expenses,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,
paid or incurred in investigating or defending against any such claim, demand,
action, suit or proceeding. The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the
termination of this Make Good Agreement, and the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent. </P>
<P align=justify><B>9. Compensation of Escrow Agent. </B>Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to compensation for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached
hereto as Exhibit A, which compensation shall be paid by the Company. The fee
agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full compensation
for Escrow Agent's services as contemplated by this Make Good Agreement;
provided, however, that in the event that Escrow Agent renders any material
service not contemplated in this Make Good Agreement, or there is any assignment
of interest in the subject matter of this Make Good Agreement, or any material
modification hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or Escrow
Agent is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Make Good Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, then Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated
by the Company for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, occasioned by any delay,
controversy, litigation or event, and the same shall be recoverable from the
Company. Prior to incurring any costs and/or expenses in connection with the
foregoing sentence, Escrow Agent shall be required to provide written notice to
the Company of such costs and/or expenses and the relevancy thereof and Escrow
Agent shall not be permitted to incur any such costs and/or expenses which are
not related to litigation prior to receiving written approval from the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. </P>
<P align=justify><B>10. Resignation of Escrow Agent. </B>At any time, upon ten
(10) Business Days' written notice to the Company and the Purchasers, Escrow
Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties as Escrow Agent hereunder. As
soon as practicable after its resignation, Escrow Agent will promptly turn over
to a successor escrow agent appointed by the Company the Escrow Shares held
hereunder upon presentation of a document appointing the new escrow agent and evidencing its acceptance thereof. If,
by the end of the 10-Business Day period following the giving of notice of
resignation by Escrow Agent, the Company shall have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent, Escrow Agent shall deposit the Escrow Shares as directed
by the Purchasers with the understanding that such Escrow Shares will continue
to be subject to the provisions of this Make Good Agreement.</P>

hereto, as the case may be, with a complete copy of such records, certified by
Escrow Agent to be a complete and accurate account of all such transactions. The

Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder of the Company may be
assigned by the Company only following the prior written consent of the
Purchasers. This Make Good Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder of
the Escrow Agent may be assigned by the Escrow Agent only with the prior consent

of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs and permitted
assigns, and none of the provisions of this Make Good Agreement are intended to
be, nor shall they be construed to be, for the benefit of any third person. No

legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of any
such party hereto prior to the disbursement thereof to such party hereto in

the provisions of this Make Good Agreement, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees from the other party (unless such
other party is the Escrow Agent), which fees may be set by the court in the
trial of such action or may be enforced in a separate action brought for that

effectuate the transfer of Escrow Shares hereunder (collectively the issuance of
securities under the Securities Purchase Agreement and the transfer of shares of

shares of Common Stock issued in the Issuance would exceed 6,018,198 shares of
Common Stock (the <B>&#147;Exchange Cap&#148;</B>), which is the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock which the Company and its affiliates may issue in
connection with such transactions without breaching the Company&#146;s obligations
under the rules or regulations of any applicable Trading Market, except that
such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the
approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of such Trading
Market for issuances of Common Stock in excess of such amount (&#147;<B>Stockholder
Approval</B>&#148;) or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the

satisfactory to the Purchasers. The Company shall seek Stockholder Approval of
the Issuance of an agreed upon maximum number of shares of Common Stock (such
maximum number to be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Lead Purchaser)
at its next regularly scheduled meeting of stockholders. The Make Good Pledgor
hereby agrees to vote any and all shares of Common Stock held by the Make Good
Pledgor at such meeting in favor of the Company&#146;s proposal to approve the
Issuance of such maximum number of shares of Common Stock.</P>

transferees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell
any or all of their shares of Common Stock on any stock exchange, market or
trading facility on which the shares are traded or quoted or in private
transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling
Stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling
shares:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-top: 12">ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the
  broker-dealer solicits Investors;
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-top: 12">block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as

  for its account;

  <LI>
  <p style="margin-top: 12">any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144
under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange
for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive
commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer
acts as agent for the Purchasers of shares, from the Purchasers) in amounts to
be negotiated. The Selling Stockholders do not expect these commissions and
discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">The Selling Stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant
a security interest in some or all of the Shares owned by them and, if they
default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured
parties may offer and sell shares of Common Stock from time to time under this
prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or
other applicable provision of the Securities Act of 1933 amending the list of
selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in
interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus.</P>

Stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a
broker-dealer for the sale of Common Stock through a block trade, special
offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a
broker or dealer, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed, if required,
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, disclosing (i) the name of
each such Selling Stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii)
the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such the shares of
Common Stock were sold, (iv)the commissions paid or discounts or concessions
allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such
broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set
out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts
material to the transaction. In addition, upon the Company being notified in
writing by a Selling Stockholder that a donee or pledgee intends to sell more
than 500 shares of Common Stock, a supplement to this prospectus will be filed
if then required in accordance with applicable securities law.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">The Selling Stockholders also may transfer the shares of Common
Stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other
successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of
this prospectus.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that
are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the
meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any
commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the
resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting
commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Discounts, concessions,
commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, that can be attributed to the
sale of Securities will be paid by the Selling Stockholder and/or the
Purchasers. Each Selling Stockholder has represented and warranted to the
Company that it acquired the securities subject to this Registration Statement
in the ordinary course of such Selling Stockholder&#146;s business and, at the time
of its purchase of such securities such Selling Stockholder had no agreements or
understandings, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute any such
securities.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">The Company has advised each Selling Stockholder that it may
not use shares registered on this Registration Statement to cover short sales of
Common Stock made prior to the date on which this Registration Statement shall
have been declared effective by the Commission. If a Selling Stockholder uses
this prospectus for any sale of the Common Stock, it will be subject to the
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The Selling Stockholders
will be responsible to comply with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act and Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder promulgated,
including, without limitation, Regulation M, as applicable to such Selling
Stockholders in connection with resales of their respective shares under this
Registration Statement.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent: 5%">The Company is required to pay all fees and expenses incident
to the registration of the shares, but the Company will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of the Common Stock. The Company has agreed to indemnify the
Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act.</P>

<P align=center><B><font size="3">American Lorain Announces $9.6 Million Private Placement to
Support <br>
Chestnut Business Growth through 2012</font></B></P>
<P align=justify>JUNAN COUNTY, China, September 13 -- American Lorain
Corporation, an international processed foods company based in Shandong
Province, People&#146;s Republic of China, announced today that it sold 3,440,800
shares of its Common Stock to Tongley Investment Ltd. and several accredited
investors in a private placement transaction, at a price of $2.80 per share for
proceeds of approximately $9.6 million, before payment of transaction fees and
expenses. The Company has agreed to register the shares for resale. In
connection with the transaction, the Company and Mr. Si Chen, the Company&#146;s
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and largest stockholder of the
Company, also entered into a make good escrow agreement and a stockholders
agreement with the investors, which will be described in and attached to a
Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company.</P>
<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s use of the newly acquired capital will be
allocated to its chestnut business and primarily used in raw chestnut
procurement during the current chestnut season. In addition to a $15 million
loan secured by the Company on June 14, 2010, the Company expects to expand its
market share in China in the chestnut sector.</P>
<P align=justify>Tongley Investment Ltd. is a private fund which focuses on
investing in Chinese growing enterprises. Tongley&#146;s major partners have years of
successful venture and investment experience within China. In recent years,
Tongley has made a series of private equity investments in food, retail and
consumer services industries, including several leading Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P align=justify>&#147;We are very pleased to welcome Tongley as a shareholder of
American Lorain,&#148; began Chairman and CEO Si Chen. &#147;Tongley&#146;s investment and
others who participated in the financing was completed at an at-the-market price
which is a clear vote of confidence in our business objectives for 2010 and
beyond. In addition to our capital obtained from our DEG loan, the combination
of both financings provide us the proper amount of working capital needed to
expand our chestnut sales, particularly in the South of China. We see the
greatest retail potential for our products in this part of China and also in
export markets. We look forward to exceeding our growth targets in 2010 and
beyond and providing positive returns back to our shareholders.&#148;</P>

Capital Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: RODM), acted as the exclusive lead placement agent
for the transaction and FT Global Capital, Inc. acted as the co-agent for the
transaction. </P>
