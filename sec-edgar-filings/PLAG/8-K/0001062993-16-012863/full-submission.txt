engage in (or own, manage, finance or control, or become engaged or serve as an

respective affiliates will be permitted under the Non-Competition and

operating subsidiary, Hubei Shengrong, was formed in 2009. Since inception,
Hubei Shengrong has been focused on the research, development, production and
sale of solid waste recycling systems for the mining and industrial sectors in
the PRC. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, Hubei Shengrong generated approximately $23.9 million and
$20.5 million, respectively, of revenue, and approximately $7.5 million and $6.6
million, respectively, of net income, from sales of its solid waste recycling
systems. Hubei Shengrong is a pioneer in China for the achievement of zero
emission of manganese tailings recycling projects. Hubei Shengrong is also a

16, 2016, the National People&#146;s Congress in the PRC issued the Thirteenth Five
Year Plan for Economic and Social Development, in which the government
established a national policy to preserve natural resources and protect the
environment. According to the Notification for National Science and Technology
Creation Plan in Thirteenth Five Year Plan issued by the PRC State Counsel on
July 28, 2016, the government encouraged the stimulation of green technology to
preserve water and mining resources.</P>

industrial and mining waste</I></B> </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using
Hubei Shengrong&#146;s high-tech systems, end users recycle refractory metal mineral
tailings, including but not limited to copper, iron, manganese and molybdenum
tailings and aluminum slag, and low grade metal minerals, into valuable metals
and construction materials, leaving no waste discharge. Based on their extensive
experience in the industry, Hubei Shengrong management believes
that Hubei Shengrong is a leading enterprise in the PRC in the design,
engineering, manufacture and sale of solid waste recycling systems for the
mining and industrial sectors in the PRC.</P>

comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Documents and
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by the Federal Securities Laws.
The Purchaser shall amend or supplement the Proxy Documents and cause the Proxy
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the holders of Purchaser Shares, in each case as and to the

Purchaser or any of its Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and

Company and its Representatives to participate with the Purchaser or its
Representatives in any discussions or meetings with the SEC and its staff. The
Company and the Sellers shall, and shall cause each of the Target Companies to,

result from any breach of a covenant made by such disclosing Party or its
Affiliates in this Agreement. Other than any updates permitted by the prior
sentence, no Supplemental Disclosure Schedule shall affect any of the conditions
to the Parties&#146; respective obligations under the Agreement (including for
purposes of determining satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in

Supplemental Disclosure Schedule) shall be deemed to have been set forth in all
other applicable parts of such disclosure schedules (or, to the extent

applicability of such disclosure to such other parts is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure. Inclusion of information in any disclosure schedule
or Supplemental Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission by
such party that such information is material to the business, properties,
financial condition or results of operations of, as applicable, the Company, the
Sellers or the Purchaser or their respective Affiliates. Matters reflected in
any disclosure schedule or Supplemental Disclosure Schedule is not necessarily

<U>Section 9.1(e)</U> or <U>Section 9.1(f)</U> or (b) by the Company pursuant to
<U>Section 9.1(d)</U>, the breaching Party shall pay to the other Party a

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this
Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable, the payment of

against the other Party or its Affiliates or any of their respective assets, or
against any of their respective directors, officers, employees or shareholders
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and

&nbsp;<U>Arbitration</U>. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other
than applications for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for enforcement of
a resolution under this <U>Section 11.4</U>) arising out of, related to, or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a
&#147;<B><I>Dispute</I></B>&#148;) shall be governed by this <U>Section 11.4</U>. A party
must, in the first instance, provide written notice of any Disputes to the other
parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably detailed
description of the matters subject to the Dispute. The parties involved in such
Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute on an amicable basis within ten (10)
Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such other parties
subject to such Dispute (the &#147;<B><I>Resolution Period</I></B>&#148;);
<U>provided</U>, that if any Dispute would reasonably be expected to have become
moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60) days after the
occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall be no Resolution Period with
respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not resolved during the Resolution
Period may immediately be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration
pursuant to the then-existing Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration
Rules (the &#147;<B><I>AAA Procedures</I></B>&#148;) of the American Arbitration
Association (the &#147;<B><I>AAA</I></B>&#148;). Any party involved in such Dispute may
submit the Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after the Resolution
Period. To the extent that the AAA Procedures and this Agreement are in
conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall control. The arbitration shall be
conducted by one arbitrator nominated by the AAA promptly (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after the submission of the Dispute to the AAA
and reasonably acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator
shall be a commercial lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes
under acquisition agreements. The arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment
and begin the arbitration process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or her nomination and
acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be
streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide the Dispute in accordance
with the substantive law of the state of New York. Time is of the essence. Each
party shall submit a proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator
within twenty (20) days after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from
doing, anything consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
applicable Law, including to perform its contractual obligation(s); provided,
that the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant party (or parties,
as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the proposals. The
arbitrator&#146;s award shall be in writing and shall include a reasonable
explanation of the arbitrator&#146;s reason(s) for selecting one or the other
proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of New
York. The language of the arbitration shall be English. </P>

<P

LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this &#147;<B><I>Agreement</I></B>&#148;) is made as of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] by and
among (i) American Lorain Corporation, a Nevada corporation (including any
successor entity thereto, the &#147;<B><I>Purchaser</I></B>&#148;), and (ii) each of the
persons listed on the signature page hereto (collectively, the
&#147;<B><I>Restricted</I></B><I> </I><B><I>Holders</I></B>&#148;). Any capitalized term
used but not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning ascribed to such
term in the Share Exchange Agreement. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
on the date hereof, Purchaser and the Restricted Holders entered into that
certain Share Exchange Agreement (as amended from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, the &#147;<B><I>Share Exchange Agreement</I></B>&#148;), by and
among Purchaser, Shengrong Environmental Protection Holding Company Limited a
business company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with limited
liability (the &#147;<B><I>Company</I></B>&#148;) and the Restricted Holders, pursuant to
which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Purchaser will acquire from
the Restricted Holders all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the
Company in exchange for 114,000,000 shares of common stock of the Purchaser (including any
equity securities paid as dividends or distribution with respect to such shares
or into which such shares are exchanged or converted, the &#147;<B><I>Exchange
Shares</I></B>&#148;); and </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>,
pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, and in view of the valuable
consideration to be received by the Restricted Holders thereunder, Purchaser and
the Restricted Holders desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant to which
the Exchange Shares shall become subject to limitations on disposition as set
forth herein. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW,
THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows: </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
<U>Lock-Up Provisions</U>. </P>
<P

Each Restricted Holder hereby agrees not to, during the period commencing from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange
Agreement (the &#147;<B><I>Closing</I></B>&#148;) and ending on (x) the one (1) year
anniversary of the date of the Closing (the &#147;<B><I>Lock-Up Period</I></B>&#148;): (i)
lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, donate, assign, sell, contract to
sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract
to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer
or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Exchange Shares, (ii) enter into any
swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of the Exchange Shares or (iii) publicly
disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction
described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above is to be settled by delivery of the Exchange Shares  or other securities, in cash or otherwise (any of the
  foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii), a &#147;<B><I>Prohibited
    Transfer</I></B>&#148;). The foregoing sentence shall not apply to the transfer of
  any or all of the Exchange Shares owned by a Restricted Holder, either during
  his lifetime or on death, (A) by gift, will or intestate succession, or (B) to
  any Affiliate, shareholder, member, partner or trust beneficiary, as the case
  may be, of such Restricted Holder; provided, however, that in any of cases (A)
  or (B) it shall be a condition to such transfer that the transferee executes and
  delivers to Purchaser an agreement stating that the transferee is receiving and
  holding the Exchange Shares subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and
  there shall be no further transfer of such Exchange Shares except in accordance
  with this Agreement. Each Restricted Holder further agrees to execute such
  agreements as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser that are consistent the
  foregoing or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Restricted Holder may during the Lock-Up
Period pledge their Exchange Shares (other than their Escrow Shares) to an
unaffiliated third party as a guarantee to secure borrowings made by such third
party to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the provisions of
this Agreement, such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be null and void ab
initio, and Purchaser shall refuse to recognize any such purported transferee of
the Exchange Shares as one of its equity holders for any purpose. In order to
enforce this <U>Section 1</U>, Purchaser may impose stop-transfer instructions
with respect to the Exchange Shares of each Restricted Holder (and permitted
transferees and assigns thereof) until the end of the Lock-Up Period. </P>

<U>Amendments and Waivers</U>. Any term of this Agreement may be amended and the
observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a
particular instance, and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the
written consent of Purchaser, and Restricted Holders holding a majority of the
Exchange Shares held by all Restricted Holders. No failure or delay by a party
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No waivers
of or exceptions to any term, condition, or provision of this Agreement, in any
one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or
continuing waiver of any such term, condition, or provision. </P>

<U>Severability</U>. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in any
way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other jurisdiction.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties will substitute for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. </P>

<U>Specific Performance</U>. Each Restricted Holder acknowledges that its
obligations under this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the

be inadequate and Purchaser may have not adequate remedy at law, and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by a Restricted Holder in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, Purchaser shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by any Restricted Holder and to seek to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other
security or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in

this Agreement, at law or in equity. </P>

foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of the rights or remedies
of Purchaser or any of the obligations of the Restricted Holders under any other
agreement between the Restricted Holders and Purchaser or any certificate or

<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in connection with, and as a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (the &#147;<B><I>Transactions</I></B>&#148;),
and to enable Purchaser to secure more fully the benefits of the Transactions,
including the protection and maintenance of the goodwill and confidential
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser has required that the
Subject Parties enter into this Agreement; </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Subject Parties are entering into this Agreement in order to induce
Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, pursuant to which each Subject Party

THEREFORE, in order to induce Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, each Subject Party hereby agrees as follows: </P>
<P

<U>Restriction</U>. Each Subject Party hereby agrees that during the period from
the Closing until the later of (i) the four (4) year anniversary of the Closing
Date and (ii) the date on which the Subject Parties, their respective Affiliates
or any of their respective officers, directors or employees are no longer

Competitor (&#147;<b><i>Permitted Ownership</i></b>&#148;), and (ii) for the avoidance of
doubt, certain family members and associates of the Subject Parties as set forth
on <u>Exhibit 1</u> hereto may continue to manage the businesses set forth next
to their respective names on <u>Exhibit 1</u> hereto consistent with past
practice prior to the date hereof, even if such businesses are Competitors, so
long as the Subject Parties are not involved in the management or control of
such Competitors. </P>

experience and training, that (i) such Subject Party possesses knowledge of
confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Business,

to Purchaser to consummate the Transactions and to realize the goodwill of the

substantial direct or indirect financial benefit, and that Purchaser would not
have entered into the Share Exchange Agreement or consummated the Transactions
but for the Subject Parties&#146; agreements set forth in this Agreement; (iii) it
would impair the goodwill of the Company and its Subsidiaries and reduce the
value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and cause serious and
irreparable injury if such Subject Party were to use its ability and knowledge
by engaging in the Business in competition with a Covered Party, and/or to
otherwise breach the obligations contained herein and that the Covered Parties
would not have an adequate remedy at law because of the unique nature of the
Business, (iv) such Subject Party has no intention of engaging in the Business
during the Restricted Period other than Permitted Ownership, (v) the relevant
public policy aspects of restrictive covenants, covenants not to compete and
non-solicitation provisions have been discussed, and every effort has been made

reasonable and necessary to protect the Covered Parties&#146; legitimate interests,
(vi) the Covered Parties conduct and intend to conduct the Business everywhere
in the Territory and compete with other businesses that are or could be located
in any part of the Territory, (vii) the foregoing restrictions on competition
are fair and reasonable in type of prohibited activity, geographic area covered,
scope and duration, (viii) the consideration provided to such Subject Party
under this Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement is not illusory, and (ix)
such provisions do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect
the goodwill or other business interests of the Covered Parties. </P>

carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, and that such Subject

Remedies. </B>The covenants and undertakings of the Subject Parties contained in
this Agreement relate to matters which are of a special, unique and
extraordinary character and a violation of any of the terms of this Agreement
may cause irreparable injury to the Covered Parties, the amount of which may be
impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated.
Each Subject Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by such Subject Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement,
each applicable Covered Party will be entitled to obtain the following remedies
(in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy at law or in equity or
pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents that
may be available to the Covered Parties, including monetary damages), and a
court of competent jurisdiction may award: (i) an injunction, restraining order
or other equitable relief restraining or preventing such breach or threatened
breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond or
security, which each Subject Party expressly waives; and (ii) recovery of the
Covered Party&#146;s attorneys&#146; fees and costs incurred in enforcing the Covered
Party&#146;s rights under this Agreement. If sought and obtained in accordance with
this Agreement, each Subject Party hereby consents to the award of any of the
above remedies to the applicable Covered Party in connection with any such
breach or threatened breach. Each Subject Party hereby acknowledges and agrees
that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, any value attributed or
allocated to this Agreement (or any other non-competition agreement with such
Subject Party) under or in connection with the Share Exchange Agreement shall
not be considered a measure of, or a limit on, the damages of the Covered
Parties. </P>

Survival of Obligations. </B>The expiration of the Restricted Period will not
relieve any Subject Party of any obligation or liability arising from any breach
by such Subject Party of this Agreement during the Restricted Period. Each
Subject Party further agrees that the time period during which the covenants
contained in <U>Section</U> <U>1</U> and <U>Section 2</U> of this Agreement will
be effective will be computed by excluding from such computation any time during
which such Subject Party is in violation of any provision of such Sections,

such exclusion prior to the date on which such time period would otherwise
expire. </P>

<U>Integration and Non-Exclusivity</U>. This Agreement, the Share Exchange
Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents contain the entire agreement between
the Subject Parties and the Covered Parties concerning the subject matter
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and remedies of the Covered
Parties under this Agreement are not exclusive of or limited by any other rights
or remedies which they may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or
otherwise, all of which will be cumulative (and not alternative). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights and remedies of the Covered
Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of each Subject Party, under this
Agreement, are in addition to their respective rights, remedies, obligations and
liabilities (i) under the laws of unfair competition, misappropriation of trade
secrets, or other requirements of statutory or common law, or any applicable
rules and regulations and (ii) otherwise conferred by contract, including the
Share Exchange Agreement and any other written agreement between a Subject Party
and any of the Covered Parties. Nothing in the Share Exchange Agreement will
limit any of the obligations, liabilities, rights or remedies of the Subject
Parties or the Covered Parties under this Agreement, nor will any breach of the
Share Exchange Agreement or any other agreement between any Subject Party and
any of the Covered Parties limit or otherwise affect any right or remedy of the
Covered Parties under this Agreement. If any term or condition of any other
agreement between any Subject Party and any of the Covered Parties conflicts or
is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the more
restrictive terms will control as to such Subject Party. </P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<U>Severability; Reformation</U>. Each provision of this Agreement is separable
from every other provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement
is found or held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
by a court of competent jurisdiction, then (i) such provision will be deemed
amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid, legal and enforceable
to the fullest possible extent, (ii) the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of such provision will not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision under any other circumstances or in any other
jurisdiction, and (iii) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of such
provision will not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the
remainder of such provision or the validity, legality or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement. The Subject Parties and the Covered Parties
will substitute for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable
and equitable provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision. Without limiting the foregoing, if any court of competent
jurisdiction determines that any part hereof is unenforceable because of the
duration, geographic area covered, scope of such provision, or otherwise, such
court will have the power to reduce the duration, geographic area covered or
scope of such provision, as the case may be, and, in its reduced form, such
provision will then be enforceable. Each Subject Party will, at a Covered
Party&#146;s request, join such Covered Party in requesting that such court take such
action. </P>

<U>Amendment; Waiver</U>. This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any
respect, except by a written agreement executed by the Subject Parties,
Purchaser and the Company (or their respective permitted successors or assigns).
No waiver will be effective unless it is expressly set forth in a written
instrument executed by the waiving party and any such waiver will have no effect
except in the specific instance in which it is given. Any delay or omission by a
party in exercising its rights under this Agreement, or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with any term, covenant, or condition of this Agreement will
not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, condition or right, nor will any
waiver or relinquishment of any right or power under this Agreement at any time
or times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any
other time or times. </P>

<U>Dispute Resolution</U>. Any dispute, difference, controversy or claim arising
in connection with or related or incidental to, or question occurring under,
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof (other than applications for a
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or
other equitable relief or application for enforcement of a resolution under this
<U>Section 7(e)</U>) (a &#147;<B><I>Dispute</I></B>&#148;) shall be governed by this
<U>Section 7(e)</U>. A party must, in the first instance, provide written notice
of any Disputes to the other parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must
provide a reasonably detailed description of the matters subject to the Dispute.
Any Dispute that is not resolved may at any time after the delivery of such
notice immediately be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant
to the then-existing Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules
(the &#147;<B><I>AAA Procedures</I></B>&#148;) of the American Arbitration Association
(the &#147;<B><I>AAA</I></B>&#148;). Any party involved in such Dispute may submit the
Dispute to the AAA to commence the proceedings after the Resolution Period. To
the extent that the AAA Procedures and this Agreement are in conflict, the terms
of this Agreement shall control. The arbitration shall be conducted by one
arbitrator nominated by the AAA promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the submission of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably
acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a
commercial lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The arbitrator shall
accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration process promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or her nomination and
acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be
streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide the Dispute in accordance
with the substantive law of the State of New York. Time is of the essence. Each
party shall submit a proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator
within twenty (20) days after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from
doing, anything consistent with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
applicable Law, including to perform its contractual obligation(s);
<u>provided</u>, that the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to
the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant
party (or parties, as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the
proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a
reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's reason(s) for selecting one or the
other proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of
New York. The language of the arbitration shall be English. </P>

heard and determined exclusively in any state or federal court located in New
York, New York (or in any court in which appeal from such courts may be taken)

party hereto hereby (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified
Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any party hereto, (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by

that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced
in or by any Specified Court and (c) waives any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Each party
agrees that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law or in equity. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or
proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on
behalf of itself, or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such
process to such party at the applicable address set forth in <U>Section

equity securities (whether by equity sale, merger or otherwise) of such Covered
Party or all or substantially all of the assets of such Covered Party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, without obtaining the consent or approval of
