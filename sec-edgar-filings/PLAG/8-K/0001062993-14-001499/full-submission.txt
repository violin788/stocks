<P align=justify><B>Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities</B> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 13, 2014 in exchange for
US$3.5 million, American Lorain Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) issued a Convertible
Promissory Note (&#147;Note&#148;) in the principal amount of US$3.5 million (the
&#147;Principal Amount&#148;) to Jade Lane Group Limited, a company incorporated under the
laws of British Virgin Islands (the &#147;Holder&#148;). </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Note,
interest on the outstanding Principal Amount accrues at a rate of 4.5% per annum
, and all accrued but unpaid interest is due and payable on June 30, 2014 and on
the last day of each quarter thereafter. If the Note is not converted pursuant
to the terms of the Note, additional interest on the outstanding Principal
Amount shall accrue at a rate of 4.5% per annum and payable at the maturity of
the Note. Unless the Note is otherwise accelerated or converted, the unpaid
Principal Amount of the Note, together with all accrued but unpaid interest, is
due and payable, at the election of the Holder, on September 13, 2014 or March
13, 2015 (&#147;Maturity Date&#148;), provided, however, if Holder fails to notify the
Company in writing by August 13, 2014 that it elects the maturity date of
September 13, 2014, then the Maturity Date will be extended to March 13, 2015.
</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the terms of
the Note, at any time commencing on or after September 13, 2014 and before March
13, 2015, the Holder, at Holder&#146;s option and upon five (5) days prior written
notice to the Company, may convert in whole or in part the outstanding Principal
Amount into a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company (&#147;Common Stock&#148;)
on a per share conversion price of $1.15 per share, as may be adjusted from time
to time pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Note (&#147;Conversion Price&#148;);
provided, however, the Company will not effect any conversion of the Note, and
the Holder will not have the right to convert any portion of the Note, to the
extent (but only to the extent) that the Holder would beneficially own in excess
of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below), which beneficial
ownership will be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The &#147;Beneficial Ownership Limitation&#148; is 9.99%
of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Note. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Note is secured by the
personal guarantee of Si Chen, the Company&#146;s chief executive officer and
chairman. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Note, the
Company engaged a finder pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay a finders
fee of $80,000 for such finder&#146;s services. The Company intends to use the net
proceeds from the Note solely in connection with the acquisition and as general
working capital for Athena, a limited liability company organized under the laws
of France. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holder has represented to the
Company that (a) it is not a &#147;U.S. Person&#148; as that term is defined pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&#147;Securities Act&#148;),
(b) it is not acquiring the Note or the underlying securities (the &#147;Securities&#148;)
for the account or benefit of, directly or indirectly, any U.S. Person, (c) it
is outside the United States when acquiring the Securities, and (d) acknowledges
and agrees that it will not engage in any hedging transactions involving any of
the Securities unless such transactions are in compliance with the provisions of
the Securities Act. The Securities were issued pursuant to Regulation S
promulgated under the Securities Act. </P>
