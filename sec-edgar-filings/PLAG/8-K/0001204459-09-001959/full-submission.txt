<p style="text-indent: 60pt" align="justify">On October 28, 2009, American Lorain Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
&quot;Company&quot;), entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the &quot;Purchase
Agreement&quot;), dated October 28, 2009, by and between the Company and the
accredited investors signatories thereto (collectively, the &quot;Investors&quot;),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investors (i) 5,011,169
shares (the &quot;Shares&quot;) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &quot;Common
Stock&quot;), (ii) Series A Warrants to purchase 1,753,909 shares of Common Stock
(the &quot;Series A Warrant Shares&quot;) and (iii) Series B Warrants to purchase
501,115
shares of Common Stock (the &quot;Series B Warrant Shares&quot; and, collectively with the
Series A Warrant Shares, the &quot;Warrant Shares&quot;). The aggregate purchase price is
approximately $12 million. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Investors have
a right to participate in up to 25%, in the aggregate, of certain future
financing transactions conducted by the Company within the next eighteen (18)
months. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 60pt" align="justify">The initial exercise price of each of the Series A Warrants and Series B
Warrants is $3.70 per share, subject to certain adjustments set forth therein,
including adjustments in the event of certain future financing transactions
conducted by the Company or in the event of a stock dividend or stock split. The
Series A Warrants become exercisable six months from the date of issuance and
have a term of five years thereafter. The Series B Warrants become exercisable
six months from the date of issuance and have a term of 30 months thereafter.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 60pt" align="justify">In connection with the transaction, the Company entered into a registration
rights agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to prepare and file a
registration statement covering the resale of the Shares and the Warrant Shares
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>

this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after
the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to
the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may designate
by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder
appearing on the books of the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy of the
Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto; and, within three (3) Trading Days of
the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company, the Company shall
have received payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby
purchased by wire transfer or, if available, pursuant to the cashless exercise
procedure specified in Section 2(c) below. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this
Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares
available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case,
the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within
three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to
the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a
portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the
effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable
hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares
purchased. The Holder may not exercise this Warrant more than four times. The
Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant
Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any
objection to any Notice of Exercise Form within 1 Business Day of receipt of
such notice. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the
Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. <B>
The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and
agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the
purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant
Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the
amount stated on the face hereof.</B></FONT></P>

  otherwise by physical delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the

  Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder certificates evidencing

  following the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the
  Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000
  of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the Common
  Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per Trading Day

  <U>Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon
  Exercise</U>. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the
  Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a
  certificate or the certificates representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to
  an exercise on or before the third Trading Day following the Warrant Share
  Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to
  purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&#146;s
  brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in
  satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder
  anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a &#147;<U>Buy-In</U>&#148;), then the
  Company shall , within three (3) Trading Days after the Holder&#146;s request and
  in the Holder&#146;s discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount
  [if any, by which (x) the Holders&#146; total purchase price (including brokerage
  commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y)
  the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the
  Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise
  at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such
  purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either
  reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares
  for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be
  deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common
  Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its
  exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder
  purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a
  Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with
  an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000,
  under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be
  required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company
  written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
  Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss.
  Nothing herein shall limit a Holder&#146;s right to pursue any other remedies
  available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation,
  a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the
  Company&#146;s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of
  Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms
  hereof.</FONT></P>

  <U>Holder&#146;s Exercise Limitations</U>. The Company shall not effect any
  exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise
  any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the
  extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth
  on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder&#146;s
  Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder
  or any of the Holder&#146;s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the
  Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the
  foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
  by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common
  Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such
  determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common
  Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining,
  nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any
  of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or
  nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including,
  without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a
  limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
  herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as set
  forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e),
  beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of
  the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it
  being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with
  Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for
  any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent
  that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination
  of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned
  by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this
  Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the
  submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder&#146;s
  determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other
  securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which
  portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the
  Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to
  verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a
  determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be
  determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules
  and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in
  determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may
  rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A)
  the Company&#146;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the
  Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the
  Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer
  Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon
  the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading
  Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of
  Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares
  of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or
  exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder
  or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding
  shares of Common Stock was reported. The &#147;<U>Beneficial Ownership Limitation</U>&#148;
  shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding
  immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock
  issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder may decrease or, upon not
  less than 61 days&#146; prior notice to the Company, may increase the Beneficial
  Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the
  Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of
  shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the
  issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the
  Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase will not be
  effective until the 61<SUP>st</SUP>
  day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of
  this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than
  in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this
  paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with
  the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make
  changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such
  limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a

<P align="justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)
<U>Stock Dividends and Splits</U>. If the Company, at any time while this
Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a
distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity
or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way
of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common
Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the
Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any)
outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event,
and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant
shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall
become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become
effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination or re-classification.</FONT></P>

<P align="justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)
<U>Subsequent Equity Sales</U>. If the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, as
applicable, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall sell or grant
any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise
dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to
purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock, at an effective price
per share less than the then Exercise Price (such lower price, the &#147;<U>Base
Share Price</U>&#148; and such issuances collectively, a &#147;<U>Dilutive Issuance</U>&#148;)
(if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall
at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset
provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or
due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection
with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an
effective price per share that is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance
shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date
of the Dilutive Issuance), then, the Exercise Price shall be reduced to a price
equal to the Base Share Price (but in no event below $3.00, adjusted for any
subsequent stock splits, reverse splits and similar capital adjustments). Such
adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustments shall be made, paid
or issued under this Section 3(b) in respect of an Exempt Issuance. The Company
shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following
the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this
Section 3(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable
reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such
notice, the &#147;<U>Dilutive Issuance Notice</U>&#148;).</FONT></P>

<P align="justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)
<U>Pro Rata Distributions</U>. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock (and not to the
Holders) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash
dividends) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security other
than the Common Stock (which shall be subject to Section 3(b)), then in each
such case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Exercise Price
in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the
denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned above,
and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then
per share fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or
evidence of indebtedness or rights or warrants so distributed applicable to one
outstanding share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in
good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described in a statement
provided to the Holder of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so
distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one share of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall
become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above.</FONT></P>

<P align="justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)
<U>Fundamental Transaction</U>. If, at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more
related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects
any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related
transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or
exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant
to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by
the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any
reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any
compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively
converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (not
including a migratory merger) or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or
more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase
agreement or other business
combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization,
spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person (not including a
migratory merger) whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other
Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with
the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination), (each
a &#147;<U>Fundamental Transaction</U>&#148;), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this
Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share
that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder
(without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this
Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring
corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional
consideration (the &#147;<U>Alternate Consideration</U>&#148;) receivable as a result of
such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such
Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on
the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such exercise, the
determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to
such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in
respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the
Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in
a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components
of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice
as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such
Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing
provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such
Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with
the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder&#146;s right to exercise such
warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant to
which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any
such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this <U>Section
3(e)</U> and insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will
be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a
Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event
of a Fundamental Transaction that is (1) an all cash transaction, (2) a &#147;Rule
13e-3 transaction&#148; as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act or (3) a
Fundamental Transaction involving a Person not traded on a national securities
exchange, the Company or any successor entity shall pay at the Holder&#146;s option,
exercisable at any time concurrently with or within 30 days after the
consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, an amount of cash equal to the
value of this Warrant as determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes option
pricing formula using an expected volatility equal to the 100-day historical
price volatility obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg L.P. as of the
trading day immediately prior to the public announcement of the Fundamental
Transaction.</FONT></P>

  <U>Delivery of Certificates Upon Exercise</U>. Certificates for shares
  purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Holder
  by crediting the account of the Holder&#146;s prime broker with the Depository
  Trust Company through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (&#147;<U>DWAC</U>&#148;)
  system if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A)
  there is an effective Registration Statement permitting the resale of the
  Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the shares are eligible for resale by the
  Holder without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, and
  otherwise by physical delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the
  Notice of Exercise by the date that is three (3) Trading Days after the
  latest of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise Form, (B)
  surrender of this Warrant (if required), and (C) payment of the aggregate
  Exercise Price as set forth above (including by cashless exercise, if
  permitted) (such date, the &#147;<U>Warrant Share Delivery Date</U>&#148;). This
  Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised on the first date on which all
  of the foregoing have been delivered to the Company. The Warrant Shares shall
  be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated
  to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such
  shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with
  payment to the Company of the Exercise Price (or by cashless exercise, if
  permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant
  to Section 2(d)(vi) prior to the issuance of such shares, having been paid.
  If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder certificates
  evidencing the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the third
  Trading Day following the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay
  to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each
  $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the
  Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per
  Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after
  such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such
  Warrant Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered or Holder
  rescinds such exercise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
  Company shall not be obligated to pay liquidated damages following the date
  of a Buy-In (as hereinafter defined) by the holder. </FONT></P>

  <U>Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon

  Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a
  certificate or the certificates representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to
  an exercise on or before the third Trading Day following the Warrant Share
  Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to
  purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&#146;s
  brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in
  satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder
  anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a &#147;<U>Buy-In</U>&#148;), then the
  Company shall , within three (3) Trading Days after the Holder&#146;s request and
  in the Holder&#146;s discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount
  [if any, by which (x) the Holders&#146; total purchase price (including brokerage
  commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y)
  the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the
  Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise
  at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such
  purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either
  reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares
  for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be
  deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common
  Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its
  exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases
  Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with
  respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate
  sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause
  (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to
  pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice
  indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and,
  upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing
  herein shall limit a Holder&#146;s right to pursue any other remedies available to
  it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of
  specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company&#146;s failure
  to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon
  exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.</FONT></P>

  on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder&#146;s

of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules
required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder
together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is
exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of
a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder&#146;s determination of whether
this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder

the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such
determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as
contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes
of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as
reflected in (A) the Company&#146;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the
Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent
setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written
or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm
orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of
the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the
date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.
The &#147;<U>Beneficial Ownership Limitation</U>&#148; shall be 4.99% of the number of
shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the
issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The
Holder may decrease or, upon not less than 61 days&#146; prior notice to the Company,
may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section
2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds
9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall
continue to apply. Any such increase will not be effective until the 61<SUP>st</SUP>
day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this
paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph
(or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended
Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or
supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.
The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of
this Warrant.</FONT></P>

  in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different
  components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are
  given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a
  Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to
  the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant
  following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate
  the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in
  such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant
  consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder&#146;s right to
  exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any
  agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall
  include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with
  the provisions of this <U>Section 3(e)</U> and insuring that this Warrant (or
  any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent
  transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything
  to the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction that is (1) an all
  cash transaction, (2) a &#147;Rule 13e-3 transaction&#148; as defined in Rule 13e-3
  under the Exchange Act or (3) a Fundamental Transaction involving a Person
  not traded on a national securities exchange, the Company or any successor
  entity shall pay at the Holder&#146;s option, exercisable at any time concurrently
  with or within 30 days after the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction,
  an amount of cash equal to the value of this Warrant as determined in
  accordance with the Black-Scholes option pricing formula using an expected
  volatility equal to the 100-day historical price volatility obtained from the
  HVT function on Bloomberg L.P. as of the trading day immediately prior to the
  public announcement of the Fundamental Transaction.</FONT></P>

  On or prior to each Filing Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the
  Commission a Registration Statement covering the resale of all, or such
  maximum portion as permitted by SEC Guidance (provided that, the Company
  shall use diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
  registration of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the SEC
  Guidance, including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly Available
  Telephone Interpretations D.29), of the Registrable Securities that are not
  then registered on an effective Registration Statement for an offering to be
  made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. Each Registration Statement
  shall be on Form S-3 (except if the Company is not then eligible to register
  for resale the Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case such
  registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith) and
  shall contain (unless otherwise directed by at least a majority in interest
  of the Holders) substantially the &#147;<U>Plan of Distribution</U>&#148; attached
  hereto as <U>Annex A</U>. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company
  shall use its best efforts to cause a Registration Statement to be declared
  effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the filing
  thereof, but in any event prior to or on the applicable Effectiveness Date,
  and shall use its best efforts to keep such Registration Statement
  continuously effective under the Securities Act from the date such
  Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act until
  all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been
  sold or may be sold without restriction under Rule 144, as determined by the
  counsel to the Company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect,
  addressed and acceptable to the Company&#146;s transfer agent and the affected
  Holders (the &#147;<U>Effectiveness Period</U>&#148;). The Company shall telephonically
  request effectiveness of a Registration Statement as of 5:00 p.m. New York
  City time on a Trading Day. The Company shall as promptly as practicable
  under the circumstances notify the Holders via facsimile or by e-mail of the
  effectiveness of a Registration Statement on the same Trading Day that the
  Company telephonically confirms effectiveness with the Commission, which shall be the date requested for effectiveness of such
  Registration Statement. The Company shall, by 9:30 a.m. New York City time on
  the Trading Day after the effective date of such Registration Statement, file
  a final Prospectus with the Commission as required by Rule 424.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance
  sets forth a limitation on the number of Registrable Securities permitted to
  be registered on a particular Registration Statement (and notwithstanding that
  the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
  registration of all or a greater portion of Registrable Securities), unless
  otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its Registrable Securities,
  the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration
  Statement will first be reduced by Registrable Securities represented by
  Warrant Shares (applied, in the case that some Warrant Shares may be
  registered, to the Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total number of
  unregistered Warrant Shares held by such Holders) and then by Registrable
  Securities represented by Shares (applied to the Holders on a pro rata basis
  based on the total number of unregistered Shares held by such Holders). </FONT></P>

  applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary of
  each such Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by
  such date) until the applicable Event is cured, the Company shall pay to each
  Holder an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
  equal to 1% of the aggregate purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to
  the Purchase Agreement for any unregistered Registrable Securities then held
  by such Holder. The parties agree that (1) the Company shall not be liable
  for liquidated damages under this Agreement with respect to any unexercised
  Warrants or Warrant Shares or with respect to any Registrable Securities that
  are not registered as a result of limitations set by SEC Guidance and
  (2)&nbsp;the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to a Holder under
  this Agreement shall be 4% of the aggregate Subscription Amount paid by such
  Holder pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If the Company fails to pay any
  partial liquidated damages pursuant to this Section in full within seven (7)
  Trading Days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at
  a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to
  be paid by applicable law) to the Holder, accruing daily from the date such
  partial liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest
  thereon, are paid in full. The partial liquidated damages pursuant to the

relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to

elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the

the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one separate counsel shall be

consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified

Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of
a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied
by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties&#146; relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys&#146; or other reasonable fees or
expenses incurred by such party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent
such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the
indemnification provided for in this Section was available to such
party in accordance with its terms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no Holder shall be
required to contribute pursuant to this Section 5(d), in the aggregate, any
amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by
such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the
Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition
to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the Indemnified
Parties.</FONT></P>

<U>Remedies</U>. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any
of their respective obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company,
as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights
granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, shall
be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. Each of
the Company and each Holder agrees that monetary damages would not provide
adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of
any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the
event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it
shall not assert or shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<U>No Piggyback on Registrations;
Prohibition on Filing Other Registration Statements</U>. Neither the
Company nor any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such
capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in any
Registration Statements other than the Registrable Securities. The Company
shall not file any other registration statements until all Registrable
Securities are registered pursuant to a Registration Statement that is declared
effective by the Commission, provided that this Section 6(b) shall not prohibit
the Company from filing amendments to registration statements filed prior to
the date of this Agreement provided that no such amendment shall increase the
number of securities registered by such registration statement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<U>Compliance</U>. Each Holder
covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to it in connection with sales
of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement.</FONT></P>

<U>Discontinued Disposition</U>.
By its acquisition of Registrable Securities, each Holder agrees that, upon
receipt of a notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind
described in Section 3(d)(iii) through (vi), such Holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under a Registration
Statement until it is advised in writing (the &#147;<U>Advice</U>&#148;) by the Company
that the use of the applicable Prospectus (as it may have been supplemented or
amended) may be resumed. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that
the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The
Company agrees and acknowledges that any periods during which the Holder is
required to discontinue the disposition of the Registrable Securities hereunder
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2(b).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
<U>Piggy-Back Registrations</U>.
If, at any time during the Effectiveness Period, there is not an effective
Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities and the
Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others
under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form
S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then
equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection
with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in
connection with the Company&#146;s stock option or other employee benefit plans,
then the Company shall deliver to each Holder a written notice of such determination
and, if within fifteen (15) days after the date of the delivery of such notice,
any such Holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such
registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities such
Holder requests to be registered; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
Company shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant
to this Section 6(e) that are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or that are the
subject of a then effective Registration Statement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)
<U>Amendments and Waivers</U>.
The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence,
may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to
departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the Company and the Holders of 67% or more of the
then outstanding Registrable Securities (including, for this purpose any
Registrable Securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of any Security).
If a Registration Statement does not register all of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to a waiver or amendment done in compliance with the previous
sentence, then the number of Registrable Securities to be registered for each
Holder shall be reduced pro rata among all Holders and each Holder shall have
the right to designate which of its Registrable Securities shall be omitted
from such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or
consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that
relates exclusively to the rights of a Holder or some Holders and that does not
directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by such
Holder or Holders of all of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented
except in accordance with the provisions of the first sentence of this Section
6(f). </FONT></P>

  permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to

  differences. The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures
  (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the Company

  required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits

and terms of this transaction and the information included in the Transaction

above, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) no Purchaser
makes any representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage

<U>Rescission and Withdrawal Right.</U> Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of) any of
the other Transaction Documents, whenever any Purchaser exercises a right,
election, demand or option under a Transaction Document and the Company does
not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided,

election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and
rights; <U>provided, however</U>, that in the case of a rescission of an
exercise of a Warrant, the applicable Purchaser shall be required to return any
shares of Common Stock subject to any such rescinded exercise notice
concurrently with the return to such Purchaser of the aggregate exercise price
paid to the Company for such shares and the restoration of such Purchaser&#146;s

<U>Remedies.</U> In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided
herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the Purchasers
and the Company will be entitled to
specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that
monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by
reason of any breach of obligations contained in the Transaction Documents and
hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any action for specific performance
of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. </FONT></P>

<P align="justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.16
<u>Payment Set Aside</u>. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments
to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document or a Purchaser enforces
or exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or the
proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered
from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored
to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other person under any law
(including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law,
common law or equitable cause of action), then, to the extent of any such

<U>Independent Nature of Purchasers&#146; Obligations and Rights</U>. The
obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and
not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall
be responsible in any way for the performance or non-performance of the
obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing
contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by
any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as
a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or
create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as
a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently
protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights
arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it
shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional
party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented
by its own separate legal counsel in their review and negotiation of the
Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience only, each
Purchaser and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the
Company through WS. WS does not represent any of the Purchasers and only
represents Rodman &amp; Renshaw, LLC. The Company has elected to provide all
Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of
the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by any of the
Purchasers. </FONT></P>

<U>Liquidated Damages</U>. The Company&#146;s obligations to pay any partial
liquidated damages or other amounts owing under the Transaction Documents is a
continuing obligation of the Company and shall not terminate until all unpaid
partial liquidated damages and other amounts have been paid, notwithstanding
the fact that the instrument or security pursuant to which such partial
liquidated damages or other amounts are due and payable shall have been
canceled. </FONT></P>
