Lorain Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) received a notice from NYSE American LLC (the
&#147;Exchange&#148;) that the Company was not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and
1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the &#147;Company Guide&#148;) since the
Company reported a stockholders&#146; equity deficit of ($3.05) million as of
December 31, 2017 and net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years
ended December 31, 2017.</P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In order to maintain its listing
on the Exchange, the Company must, by May 21, 2018, submit a plan of compliance
(the &#147;Plan&#148;) advising the Exchange of actions it has taken or will take to
regain compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide
by October 21, 2019 (the &#147;Plan Period&#148;). If the Plan is accepted by the
Exchange, then the Company will be able to continue its listing during the Plan
Period, during which time it will be subject to periodic monitoring for
compliance with the Plan. If the Plan is not accepted by the Exchange, then the
Company will be subject to delisting proceedings. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">In addition, the Exchange has
informed the Company that the Company&#146;s securities have been selling for a low
price per share for a substantial period of time. Consequently, pursuant to
Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the Company&#146;s continued listing is
predicated on the Company&#146;s effecting a reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s
common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement by no later
than October 19, 2018. </P>
<P align=justify style="text-indent:5%">The Company&#146;s management is
beginning its analysis regarding submission of a Plan to the Exchange by the May
21, 2018 deadline. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to achieve compliance with the Exchange&#146;s continued listing standards
within the required time period.</P>
