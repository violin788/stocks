</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;28, 2017, AstroNova, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement (the
&#147;Agreement&#148;) with Honeywell International, Inc. (&#147;Honeywell&#148;), pursuant to which the Company acquired an exclusive perpetual world-wide license to manufacture Honeywell&#146;s narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft
families (the &#147;Product Line&#148;) along with certain inventory and equipment used in the manufacturing and certain contracts for an initial total purchase price of $15&nbsp;million (the &#147;Initial Purchase Price&#148;). The Initial Purchase
Price includes an upfront payment of $14.6&nbsp;million in cash and a second payment of $400,000 upon completion of the manufacturing transition. The Company financed the Initial Purchase Price paid at closing using borrowings under its existing
revolving credit facility discussed in more detail below. The Agreement also provides for the assumption of certain liabilities, royalty payments based on gross revenues from the sales in the Product Line of the printers, paper and repair services,
with minimum total royalty payments equal to $15&nbsp;million in the aggregate, to be paid over the next ten years, and additional contingent royalties based on percentages of the Company&#146;s gross revenues from the sales in the Product Line of
the printers, paper, and repair service. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and the product sold or service provided and range from single digit to mid double digit percentages of gross revenue. The foregoing
description of the material terms of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, reference to the full terms of the Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form <FONT

into a Transition Services Agreement with Honeywell related to the transition over the next several months of the manufacturing of the Honeywell printers from its current location in Asia to AstroNova&#146;s plant in West Warwick, Rhode Island. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Amendment to Credit Facility </I></P>

Agreement&#148;). The First Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to permit the purchase of the Product Line, add collateral securing the Company&#146;s obligations under the Credit Agreement, and temporarily increase the amount available for
borrowing under the revolving credit line from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000. The foregoing description of the material terms of the First Amendment does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, reference to
