<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;30, 2017, AstroNova, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a Second Amendment (the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;) to the
Credit Agreement dated as of February&nbsp;28, 2017 (as previously amended and modified from time to time, including by that certain First Amendment dated as of September&nbsp;28, 2017 (the &#147;First Amendment&#148;), the &#147;Credit
Agreement&#148;; the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Second Amendment, the &#147;Amended Credit Agreement&#148;), by and among Bank of America, N.A., as lender (the &#147;Lender&#148;), ANI ApS, a Danish private limited liability company and
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#147;ANI&#148;), and Trojan Label ApS, a Danish private limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of ANI. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Second Amendment provides for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15,000,000 (the &#147;U.S. Term Loan&#148;), in
addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI at the original closing under the Credit Agreement (the &#147;Danish Term Loan&#148;). The Company borrowed the entire U.S. Term Loan upon the
closing of the Second Amendment on November&nbsp;30, 2017 and used the proceeds thereof to repay the entire $14,600,000 principal balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility immediately prior to the closing of the
Second Amendment, and the remaining proceeds of the U.S. Term Loan were retained by the Company to be used for its general corporate purposes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the principal amount of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, which had been temporarily
increased to $15,000,000 pursuant to the First Amendment, was reduced to $10,000,000 effective upon the closing of the Second Amendment, and the revolving credit facility termination and maturity date was extended from January&nbsp;31, 2022 to
November&nbsp;22, 2022. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. Term Loan is required to be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the
Company over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement, commencing with its fiscal quarter ending on January&nbsp;31, 2018. The principal amount of each quarterly installment required to be paid is $750,000, and any remaining principal balance of the
term loan is required to be paid on November&nbsp;30, 2022. The Company may voluntarily prepay the term loan, in whole or in part, from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable). No amount of the
U.S. Term Loan that is repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. Term Loan, like the Danish Term Loan and the revolving credit loans,
is subject to certain mandatory prepayments, subject to various exceptions, from the net cash proceeds from certain dispositions of property, certain issuances of equity, certain issuances of additional debt and certain extraordinary receipts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. Term Loan bears interest at a rate <I>per annum</I> equal to, at the Company&#146;s option, either (a)&nbsp;the Eurocurrency Rate (as
defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Company&#146;s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b)&nbsp;a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i)&nbsp;the federal fund rate plus
0.50%, (ii) Bank of America&#146;s publicly announced prime rate or (iii)&nbsp;the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Company&#146;s consolidated leverage ratio. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s obligations in respect of the U.S. Term Loan (and the revolving credit
facility and its existing guarantee in respect of the Danish Term Loan) are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI and the Company&#146;s
wholly-owned German subsidiary AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Second Amendment, the Company
entered into certain hedging arrangements with Bank of America to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments in respect of the U.S. Term Loan. These arrangements were documented using an industry standard contract known as
an International Swaps and Derivative Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreement, together with a Schedule to the Master Agreement and certain related agreements. </P>

unless (i)&nbsp;the Lender (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (ii)&nbsp;in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Company shall have notified the

to so reimburse the Lender by such time, the U.S. Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in
Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the &#147;<U>Unreimbursed Amount</U>&#148;), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section&nbsp;2.02
