AstroNova, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the &#147;A&amp;R Credit Agreement&#148;) with Bank of America, N.A., as lender (the &#147;Lender&#148;), ANI ApS, a Danish private limited liability
company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and TrojanLabel ApS, a Danish private limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of ANI ApS (&#147;TrojanLabel&#148;). The A&amp;R Credit Agreement amended and restated the Credit
Agreement dated as of February&nbsp;28, 2017 (the &#147;Existing Credit Agreement&#148;) by and among the Company, ANI ApS, TrojanLabel and the Lender. In connection with the A&amp;R Credit Agreement, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated
Security and Pledge Agreement (the &#147;Security Agreement&#148;) and a mortgage in favor of the Lender with respect to the Company&#146;s owned real property in West Warwick, Rhode Island (the &#147;Mortgage&#148;). Immediately prior to the
closing of the A&amp;R Credit Agreement, the Company repaid $1,500,000 in principal amount of term loans outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the A&amp;R Credit Agreement, the Company is the sole borrower and its obligations are guaranteed by ANI ApS and TrojanLabel. The
A&amp;R Credit Agreement provides for (i)&nbsp;a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15,232,000, which was used to refinance the outstanding term loans borrowed by the Company and ANI ApS under the Existing Credit Agreement and a
portion of the outstanding revolving loans borrowed by the Company under the Existing Credit Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;a $10,000,000 revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes. Revolving credit loans may be
borrowed, at the Company&#146;s option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner. At the closing of the A&amp;R Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed the entire term loan and
$6,500,000 in principal amount under the revolving credit facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Like the Existing Credit Agreement, the A&amp;R Credit Agreement
requires that the term loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company over the term of the A&amp;R Credit Agreement. The A&amp;R Credit Agreement modified the term loan repayment schedule as follows: the
principal amount of each quarterly installment required to be paid on the last day of each of the Company&#146;s fiscal quarters ending July&nbsp;31, 2020 and October&nbsp;31, 2020 was reduced by $500,000 for each quarter to $802,000; the principal
amount of the quarterly installment required to be paid on the last day of the Company&#146;s fiscal quarter ending January&nbsp;31, 2021 was reduced by $300,000 to $1,052,000; the principal amount of the quarterly installment required to be paid on
the last day of the Company&#146;s fiscal quarter ending April&nbsp;30, 2021 was reduced by $250,000 to $1,144,000; the principal amount of each quarterly installment required to be paid on the last day of each of the Company&#146;s fiscal quarters
ending July&nbsp;31, 2021, October&nbsp;31, 2021, January&nbsp;31, 2022 and April&nbsp;30, 2022 remains $1,394,000; the entire remaining principal balance of the term loan is required to be paid on June&nbsp;15, 2022. The Company may voluntarily
prepay the term loan, in whole or in part, from time to time without premium </P>

or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable). The Company may repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary
breakage costs, if applicable), but in any event no later than June&nbsp;15, 2022, and any outstanding revolving loans thereunder will be due and payable in full, and the revolving credit facility will terminate, on such date. The Company may reduce
or terminate the revolving line of credit at any time, subject to certain thresholds and conditions, without premium or penalty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As under
the Existing Credit Agreement, the loans under the A&amp;R Credit Agreement are subject to certain mandatory prepayments, subject to various exceptions, from (a)&nbsp;net cash proceeds from certain dispositions of property, (b)&nbsp;net cash
proceeds from certain issuances of equity, (c)&nbsp;net cash proceeds from certain issuances of additional debt and (d)&nbsp;net cash proceeds from certain extraordinary receipts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Amounts repaid under the revolving credit facility may be reborrowed, subject to continued compliance with the A&amp;R Credit Agreement. No
amount of the term loan that is repaid may be reborrowed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The interest rates under the A&amp;R Credit Agreement were modified as follows.
The term loan and revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company&#146;s option, either (a)&nbsp;the LIBOR Rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the
applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 2.15% to 3.65% based on the Company&#146;s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b)&nbsp;a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i)&nbsp;the federal fund rate plus 0.50%,
(ii) Bank of America&#146;s publicly announced prime rate, (iii)&nbsp;the LIBOR Rate plus 1.00% or (iv) 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.15% to 2.65% based on the Company&#146;s consolidated leverage ratio. In addition to certain
other fees and expenses that the Company is required to pay to the Lender, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility that varies within a range of .25% and .675% based on the
Company&#146;s consolidated leverage ratio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As under the Existing Credit Agreement, the Company must comply with various customary
financial and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-financial</FONT> covenants under the A&amp;R Credit Agreement. In addition to the financial covenants under the Existing Credit Agreement, which consisted of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a
minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum level of EBITDA, the A&amp;R Credit Agreement includes a consolidated asset coverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity. The primary
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-financial</FONT> covenants limit the Company&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146; ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on their capital stock, to
repurchase or acquire their capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each

payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section&nbsp;3.01(a)) the

reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or
