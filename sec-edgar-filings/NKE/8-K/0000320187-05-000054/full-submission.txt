Beaverton, OR (June 27, 2005) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
record financial results for the 2005 fiscal year, ended May 31, 2005.
Earnings per diluted share for the year grew 28 percent to $4.48,
supported by double digit revenue growth and record gross margins.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, revenues increased 12 percent
to $13.7 billion, compared to $12.3 billion in fiscal year 2004.
Changes in currency exchange rates contributed three percentage points
of this growth, while the acquisition of Converse and Starter added one
point.  Full year net income was up 28 percent to $1.2 billion, or
$4.48 per diluted share, versus $945.6 million, or $3.51 per diluted
share, in 2004.

Fourth quarter revenues increased seven percent to $3.7 billion, versus
$3.5 billion for the same period last year.  Three percentage points of
this growth were the result of changes in currency exchange rates.
Fourth quarter net income was up 15 percent to $349.5 million, or $1.30
per diluted share, compared to $305.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted
share in the prior year.

Commenting on the company's results, William D. Perez, Nike, Inc.
President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Fiscal 2005 was a great
year.  The strength of the Nike brand around the world, the breadth of
our Nike, Inc. portfolio, and the quality of our management team
contributed to another year of consistent, profitable growth for our
shareholders. The Nike brand is exceptionally strong, driving full-year
revenue gains across all regions and product lines, while Converse and
Cole Haan led the growth in our portfolio of other businesses. Today's record
earnings were driven by healthy revenue growth and the highest gross margin in
the company's history."

Perez continued, "Looking ahead, our worldwide futures orders for
athletic footwear and apparel are strong, up 9.5 percent, with all
regions posting increases and U.S. footwear remaining particularly
healthy.  We're very pleased with the brand strength reflected in these
futures results and we see continued potential for profitable expansion
across our portfolio of businesses."*


Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from June through November 2005,
totaling $6.3 billion, 9.5 percent higher than such orders reported for
the same period last year.  Approximately one point of this growth was
due to changes in currency exchange rates.*

By region, U.S. futures were up nine percent; Europe increased seven
percent; Asia Pacific grew 11 percent; and the Americas increased 25
percent.  Changes in currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of
two percentage points in Europe and Asia Pacific.  Changes in currency

this charge was not material to our effective tax rate for the quarter
or the full year.
