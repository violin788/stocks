                      NIKE REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS
                           PER SHARE UP 47 PERCENT;
                 WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS INCREASE 9.1 PERCENT

Highlights:

     -  Record second quarter earnings per diluted share increased 47
        percent to $0.97 versus $0.66 per diluted share a year ago
     -  Highest second quarter revenues, up 11 percent to $3.1 billion
     -  Gross margin improved 1.8 points to 44.1 percent
     -  Worldwide futures orders increased 9.1 percent

Beaverton, OR (December 16, 2004) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
revenues and earnings for the Company's second quarter ended November 30,
2004.  Second quarter revenues increased 11 percent to $3.1 billion, versus
$2.8 billion for the same period last year. Second quarter net income
totaled $261.9 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $179.1
million, or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior year.

"We posted another quarter of record results," said Philip H. Knight,
Chairman and CEO.  "Nike's second quarter revenues and earnings per share
reached all-time high levels as a result of solid performance across our
global portfolio.  Our businesses in the United States and emerging markets
such as China, Russia and Turkey, combined with favorable European exchange
rates, helped drive much of this growth."*

Knight added, "With the first half of our fiscal year in the books, we
remain confident that our business strategy and consistent execution will
allow us to deliver on our goals of healthy, profitable growth."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2004 through April 2005,
totaling $4.9 billion, 9.1 percent higher than such orders reported for the
same period last year.  Currency exchange rates had no net impact to this
growth.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up 10 percent; Europe increased
six percent; Asia Pacific grew 14 percent; and the Americas increased 15
percent.  In Europe, one point of the increase was due to currency exchange
rates.  Currency exchange reduced the growth in Asia Pacific and the
Americas by approximately one point and three points, respectively.*

Knight continued, "Consumer demand for Nike products continues to grow, as
evidenced by our sixth consecutive quarter of strong futures results.  The
U.S. market has been particularly robust, reporting futures growth of 10
percent.  The Nike brand is healthier than ever and our innovative products
continue to excite consumers around the world."*
