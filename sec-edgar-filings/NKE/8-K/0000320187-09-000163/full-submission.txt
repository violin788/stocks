Welcome to NIKE's fiscal 2010 second quarter conference call. For those who need to reference today's press release, you will
find it at www.nikebiz.com. Leading today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice President of Investor Relations.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Before I turn the call over to Ms. Catlett, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports
filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods, due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations and discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative
reconciliations are found at NIKE's website. This call might also include discussion of nonpublic financial and statistical information, which is also publicly available on that site, www.NIKEbiz.com.</font></div>

Happy holidays, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2010 second quarter results.

And finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks we will be happy to take your questions. We would like
to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time today, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have any additional questions that are not covered by others, please do feel free to re-queue, and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Mark Parker:</font> Thanks, Pam, and happy holidays, everybody. It was about a year ago that I told you that NIKE would perform well in this challenging economy and expand our lead over our competitors by doing what we do best, and that's delivering superior innovative
product, connecting with our consumers, creating compelling marketplace experiences and operating with discipline and efficiency. As our performance over the last year clearly indicates, we are executing these strategies and winning in the marketplace. We continue to lead the industry in footwear and apparel product innovation, and we are doing that across multiple categories and geographies and up and down the price spectrum.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our portfolio of global brands has deepened our personal connections with consumers. We continue to create compelling marketplace experiences with our retail partners in the NIKE-owned retail stores and online. And we are managing our business to balance ongoing investments in long-term growth with current profitability and cash flow.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Sticking with these principles allows NIKE, Inc. to expand competitive separation across multiple dimensions. We continue to gain share in key markets around the world and outperform the industry. Even as revenues dip a bit, our second quarter shows we are able to deliver an appropriate level of financial performance in a rapidly changing
environment. By tightly managing the inventory on our books and in the marketplace, we have strengthened our brands, maintained profitability for NIKE and our retail partners and positioned ourselves for accelerated growth as consumer confidence returns.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As we move into the second half of fiscal 2010, I have to say I'm very excited about how we are executing against our key growth opportunities. I see a lot of momentum in our direct-to-consumer business, where we continue to deliver positive results, especially online. We are doing a good job of developing our retail capabilities, and as I've
said many times, that makes us a better wholesale partner and a better company.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">This really came to life in Tokyo, where we opened a new NIKE flagship store at Harajuku. It's a great example of how innovative retail experiences really connect with consumers, even in a very tough economy like Japan. As we evolve, we are getting increasingly better at product design, assortment planning, product flow and merchandising,
all because we are executing everything with that consumer experience in mind.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're also seeing the power of our category offense yield insights that drive excellence from product creation all the way through to the retail floor, and we continue to see opportunities to build on that category strength beyond the NIKE Brand. Football is a great example where we are leveraging the most powerful dimensions in sports, specifically
the global passion for the game, the upcoming World Cup and our position as the world's biggest football company. It's a perfect storm that allows us to deliver compelling experiences, innovative product from NIKE and Umbro, like the CTR360 football boot and the tailored England National Team jersey all the way through retail experiences like the Boot Room in NIKE Towns.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And the recent launch of Lace Up, Save Lives in London, which is just another example of how we are able to deepen our connection with consumers while working to make the world a better place. As you will hear from Charlie in a minute, our focus and investment in football has completely changed the competitive landscape in that sport. Product
innovation is what created this company and what continues to separate us from all others. We are in markets with LunarGlide, the Trainer 1, Pro Combat, all concepts with tremendous potential for continued evolution and longevity.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And, as we have demonstrated with Flywire, for example, we are able to use innovation to drive profitable growth across our business portfolio, from NIKE basketball, running and training footwear to Hurley board shorts and Cole Haan footwear. And we have a lot more product innovation in the pipeline.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Down in Laguna Beach consumers are responding strongly to our Action Sports store concept, where we have NIKE, Converse and Hurley all under one roof. In fact, we just opened a second store in Irvine, and both are excellent examples of how we are being more surgical with our brands and bringing together unique and targeted opportunities that
are consumer driven.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But you don't have to be in a store to see the reach of NIKE, Inc. You can walk down the street and see Air Max 2009's, Hurley board shorts, custom Chucks, Cole Haan bags, an Umbro tee, a pair of retro Air Jordan 12's -- all unique, iconic products, each with sustainable, long-term relevance. And as you know, we have also taken a lot of aggressive
and strategic actions internally over this past year. And we did it to get even more focused and surgical externally. We are able to move more quickly and decisively, like a small company, and yet still work the levers that only the industry leader can pull.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">At the end of the day we are becoming a better NIKE, Inc., more insightful in our product creation, more aligned and surgical in getting after opportunities, efficient in our go-to-market practices and more innovative on the retail floor.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We all still face some significant headwinds in the global economy and while consumers are gaining confidence, they remain cautious and prudent. But given what we all know about the marketplace and about ourselves, we are well positioned to leverage the power of global sports and drive hard against those growth opportunities that have the
most impact.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now here's Charlie.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Charlie Denson:</font> Thanks, Mark, and happy holidays to everybody. Well, I feel good about our future performance. The strength of the NIKE Brand remains in a very enviable position. I feel good that we've been a very solid performer in what has been a very challenging
environment, and I feel good about our future. It's why we spend so much time thinking about our brand strength, managing the business, controlling expenses and driving heat into the marketplace by connecting with consumers.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And we continue to deliver on our primary objective, to create authentic product innovation for athletes all over the world.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Mark mentioned the importance of separation in the marketplace. Clearly, the impact of the strategic changes we've made both internally and externally over the last year helped us focus on key opportunities. I continue to call out our move to our category offense and our ability to execute it. Spring 2009 was our first full season in this
formation, and we continue to fine-tune and focus on the benefits it's bringing, building momentum and leveraging deeper insights and connectivity.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Sub-segmenting the business by category and geography enables us to accelerate growth by delivering integrated, sharply focused product innovations, brand connections and retail experiences to our consumers. It's how we capture short- to mid-term opportunities and, more importantly, how we leverage the power of sport to grow the overall marketplace.
We can drill down with tremendous visibility into specific regions, sports and demographics to get very surgical with our product innovation, messaging and go-to-market strategies.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That's why we continue to pick up share and expand our leadership position across the industry worldwide. So, here's a few quick examples.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Basketball we continue to see the game and our brand gain momentum. The big story focuses on a he couple of franchise products, the LeBron VII and the brand-new Kobe V, which we just launched last week. It's pure NIKE -- use technology and innovation to create a project that defies logic, put it on an incredible athlete that establishes
its credibility and shift the traditional paradigm that says you have to wear a high-top basketball shoe to play at the highest level.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Running we used marathons in Chicago, San Francisco and New York, along with the second annual Human Race, our global NIKE+event, and a fully immersed NIKETOWN presence to create an interconnected consumer experience that drove tremendous sell-through of the LunarGlide, our best-selling new shoe of the year and a big step forward in bringing
energy to running at retail.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Apparel, Pro Combat has taken its rightful spot on the performance side of the U.S. apparel business. Nobody can match our relevance or performance in protective base-layer technology. Over the last 12 months we have added about 4 points of market share and we feel like we're just getting started.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As exciting as the last three months have been, its the next nine months that I'm really looking forward to. You're going to see even more of that integrated category offense beginning this spring with a concept we call Fresh Air. We are taking NIKE Air, our iconic cushioning system, and creating a whole new level of performance, aesthetics
and comfort that will play out across multiple categories. This is a tremendous opportunity to leverage the strength of the NIKE Brand and a key franchise technology to energize the marketplace.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Next, in Football, we continue to redefine the game. Everyone knows the big story coming up is World Cup. I'm not prepared to drop the curtain just yet, but here's what I will say. You can expect to see unprecedented intensity in our marketing and messaging, a global network of grassroots and community experiences and a new generation of boots
that are the lightest and most responsive in the history of the sport, true game-changing innovation.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As Mark said, NIKE is the biggest football company in the world. I would add that we are also the most innovative, and I'm confident that what we have coming will put to rest any claims to the contrary.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And we're not stopping there. We will follow up our World Cup efforts with a couple of other surprises that I'm going to leave under the tree for now. They will be something we'll be talking about in upcoming calls, when I'll be able to be more specific. I've talked a lot about product today because it gives us the power to drive two critical
and distinguishing competitive advantages -- building and leveraging the power of the NIKE Brand and connecting that power to consumers through premium experiences out in the marketplace.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We've done a lot of things right to get where we are today, and we've got a lot more planned as we move through the second half. I'm very excited and optimistic about this brand, what this brand is capable of doing. I'm not focused on calling a bottom or predicting a turnaround. My sites are focused on growing this brand and serving its consumers.
I have no doubts that what you see from NIKE between now and next fall will show you once again just how connected this brand is to our consumers and our opportunities.</font></div>

While it's not a surprise that I agree with Charlie and Mark, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses so far this year.

indicators remain mixed, and not all of our businesses are recovering at the same pace.</font></div>

Most important, by continuing to invest in our businesses while reducing costs and aggressively managing inventories, we have positioned ourselves to accelerate
growth and profitability as consumer confidence strengthens.</font></div>

Second quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, down 4% on both a reported and constant currency basis. NIKE Brand revenue was down 4% while other business revenue was up 1%. Futures orders for NIKE Brand Footwear and Apparel scheduled for delivery from December through April 2010 declined 1%
on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting sequential improvement from holiday 2009 through the spring and summer 2010 seasons. On a real dollar basis we estimate futures orders will be 4% higher than the prior year.</font></div>

Gross margin for the quarter declined 20 basis points to 44.5%. The decline was driven largely by unfavorable FX and higher discounts, partially offset by higher in-line product margins
driven by lower raw material and freight costs.</font></div>

Demand creation was 2% lower than last year, due in part to a shift in spending to support second-half market initiatives, including Fresh Air and the World Cup. Operating overhead fell 6% overall, reflecting lower costs for headcount, travel and meetings.
Retail overhead grew 6%, driven by new store openings.</font></div>

We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the currency gains included in other income increased pre-tax income growth by $10 million for the quarter and decreased pre-tax income growth by $18 million
year-to-date.</font></div>

The improvement was a result of the settlement of uncertain tax positions as well as continued benefit from international businesses, where tax rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate. At this stage we expect our effective tax
rate for fiscal 2010 will be approximately 25%.</font></div>

At the end of the second quarter our cash and short-term investments totaled $4 billion or over $8 per diluted share. Tight working capital management was a key contributor to this increase. Versus last year's the second-quarter
end, accounts receivable declined 1% and inventory fell 10%, the latter reflecting a 19% decline in inventory units for the NIKE Brand.</font></div>

In North America second-quarter revenue declined 4%, reflecting a 7% decline in wholesale revenues. Direct-to-consumer sales grew 14% for the quarter as comp store sales grew 9% and online sales advanced 23%. Profitability for NIKE's direct-to-consumer businesses also surged during the quarter
as significantly lower promotions drove gross margin upsides versus last year.</font></div>

Revenues for NIKE Basketball, Jordan and Athletic Training were higher for the quarter, while all other categories declined. While overall industry sales trends have been challenging, we have continued to gain market share in the U.S. For the 12 months ended October 2009, NPD

As a result of the work we have done to improve the product line, clean up distribution and manage inventories, the Apparel business in North America is much healthier than it's been in some time. North American apparel revenue was down 6% in Q2, but full price sales grew 2% while off-price revenues
dropped over 60%. As a result, Apparel gross margins were significantly better than the prior year, positioning us for profitable growth in future quarters.</font></div>

In Western Europe revenue for the quarter declined 6% including a 2-percentage point benefit from the weaker dollar. Excluding the currency impact Footwear revenue declined 1% and
Apparel revenue fell 16% as a result of tough market conditions and lower off-price sales. Although all territories in the geography except Austria/Germany/Switzerland reported lower revenues, we continue to maintain overall market share and share leadership in the five largest markets in Europe. Most categories reflected the overall market softness, although Action Sports and Basketball delivered year-over-year growth in the quarter.</font></div>

The macro environment remains challenging as most countries continue to experience declining GDP, rising unemployment and significant currency fluctuations. Russia and Central Europe have been
particularly difficult, but there are some signs of stabilization. South Africa posted higher revenue for the quarter as the football category drives strong growth in advance of next year's World Cup.</font></div>

Although most categories were down with the market, we are particularly excited
about our progress in Running, where revenues grew 10% for the quarter. Second-quarter EBIT for Japan fell 19% as lower revenues and higher SG&amp;A were partially offset by gross margin improvements.</font></div>

As FX headwinds moderate and we continue to effectively manage product costs and inventory levels, we expect gross margins for the second half of fiscal 2010 to be above prior-year
levels. With a slight increase in Q3 and more significant growth in Q4, we now expect full-year gross margins to be about flat to FY '09.</font></div>

As a result, we expect second half SG&amp;A to increase at a low double-digit percentage rate versus a year ago with a heavier weighting in Q4.
For the full fiscal year we now expect SG&amp;A to be roughly in line with the prior year.</font></div>

I guess the big question that we've been getting from a lot of people, and you didn't really talk about it at all, but the Tiger Woods situation. Is there any statement
that you can make around impacts that you see on the business orders, inventories? And then I have another question that's different, totally different.</font></div>

First of all, you have to recognize that NIKE has about a $650 million golf business, which, as you know, like the rest of the broader golf market, has really been among the most impacted or probably hardest-hit
segments of our business, particularly in this economic environment, over the past year. That said, I want to quickly add that we feel very good about how we are managing our golf business through this period and our position in the broader golf market and then, certainly, with our confidence in our growth potential going forward there.</font></div>

will rally around soccer as a category, as you think about the back half of the year? When you look at the changes that you've seen in the business and order trend there, how much of it do you think is related to the World Cup?</font></div>

And you're going to see a pretty aggressive approach to that business from us, starting in probably Q4 and working all the way through the actual event that starts June 11 and ends July 11. So we feel pretty good about it, and I think the event itself is going to be
a success. I think South Africa is ready, and with that being in the same time zone as Western and Central Europe, the ability to stay connected to the event for that Western European marketplace is a big advantage.

Well, we usually don't get into quantifying all the drivers. But, as I said, some of the key elements of gross margin for the quarter were that we definitely are seeing positive benefit for in-line product costs. That's both a combination
of the work we have been doing around lean manufacturing and raw materials consolidation as well as some of the benefits we're getting from raw materials and freight costs. So it's both how we are managing the supply chain as well as some of the macroeconomic factors; that's an upside.</font></div>

It's not to the level it was earlier in the year, but we are still up year-on-year as we continue to work to move through inventories on a pretty expeditious basis. And foreign exchange is a moderating negative, is the way I would frame that. It was a negative impact for Q2. It's getting better than
Q1, and we expect over the balance of the year it's actually going to turn the other way. So as we gave on the guidance, we expect Q3 to be up slightly and then Q4 to be up more significantly.</font></div>

Our inventories are down dramatically, and our performance apparel, which is obviously the cornerstone to what we do from a brand standpoint has continued to improve, as we've pointed out some of the Pro Combat executions here in the United States as well as in Europe around the sport of football.</font></div>

done, I think, an excellent job in reducing the numbers of styles and then increasing the productivity per style.</font></div>

I just wanted to focus on the China business for a minute, if it's okay, maybe start with the capacity growth for the NIKE-branded stores there. I think that in 2009 to date that net square
footage of those stores has been negative but slowing declined lately, if I'm correct. I was just wondering if you have any visibility yet on first half of 2010, if we are going to be turning positive, based on your current plans.</font></div>

competitive environments in those third and fourth-tier cities?</font></div>

We've certainly been adding stores pretty consistently over the last several years. The growth in this fiscal year is less than last fiscal year,
and the ramp up to the Olympics, but we are still adding store space. And so we are still seeing a net increase in square footage and number of doors.</font></div>

So I think, going forward, there certainly is going to be a lot more distribution
in those lower-tier cities.</font></div>

Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing represent a fairly -- I mean, are fairly consistent with a global retail environment, and your cost bases are much higher. I think, in the other
cities, you're looking at lower operating costs, which enable us to continue to move forward at a relatively healthy pace. And, as you continue to see an economic development of the, quote-unquote, emerging middle class move further and further west, that just represents another large opportunity for us, as we look at China as one of the biggest growth opportunities in the portfolio over the next three to five years.</font></div>

But I think that the things that you did mention are all playing factors in the performance of that Western European geography. I think that
group has done a great job of really dealing with inventory management through the last nine to 12 months. As we talked, the Footwear business is very stable, still seeing Apparel weak. And that still will represent a pretty large opportunity for us, I think, over the next 12 to 18 months, hopefully.

as some companies who have been involved in sports marketing get out of the business or get out of the activity -- do you expect this to change the landscape at all? How are you thinking about sports marketing overall as you think about the brand over the next three to five years?</font></div>

us in the marketplace, and ultimately the overall business performance of the Company. That has hopefully been loud and clear in terms of our messages through many, many years. So this is a strategy that works. It's helping NIKE win and continue to win in the marketplace, not just over this last year, but over these last 37, 38 years. And I think it's one that will continue to help us extend our leadership as a company.</font></div>

Obviously, from a percentage standpoint Umbro is a one-category business, in football. So they tend to be a little bit more focused on events as opposed to the overall impact on the NIKE Brand.

Brand business is far larger, and that has a much more significant impact for NIKE, Inc. on the brand side.</font></div>

The U.S. business is still down, I think, 4%, and our futures are at 4%, so still a relatively challenging environment. We've talked over the last couple of calls about the strength of the
brand and some of the share gains that we've had, I think, as we've outperformed the market place, so to speak.</font></div>

We are seeing it as we come into the holiday period. Our outlet store program is driving a lot of our positive results, for all the obvious reasons, I think. And I think we've done
a much better job this year in both merchandising and putting the right inventory into those stores as a distribution channel.</font></div>

Obviously, one of the things that many retailers face is tough traffic comparisons. But one of the things driving our retail performance is actually better execution.

My second question here is just for Don. When you guys talk about the SG&amp;A spend, in the second half of the year being up, I believe, low double digits, I think you said, is it fair to say that obviously in the
third quarter less of an increase relative to the fourth quarter? And I guess fourth quarter is a combination of World Cup and the Fresh Air campaign? Or does the Fresh Air campaign start in Q3? Could you maybe just talk about the variability between the two quarters, if you could?</font></div>

<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Three areas.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> So I think I get the gist of the question. So the branded piece of the business, which is driven primarily from performance -- feel very good about it and actually feel very positive with that on a worldwide basis. We talked about that over the last couple
of calls. We continue to innovate. I think your reference to branded license is actually the license business that we have around our college programs and our club programs in Europe in football. That has remained pretty steady throughout the time period. Obviously, we continue to see relatively the same amount of participation in that area on the field. And then off the field the fan wear piece of it remains pretty strong.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We had another fantastic year in college football here in the U.S. I think we've got 46 of the 68 bowl teams, and I think we had 22 out of the top 25 programs this year. So again, a very strong performance here in the U.S.A. I think the license business, the kid business in Europe around football, has been solid. And then, as we ramp up towards
World Cup, we will see a little bit of an uptick in those numbers for Q4.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And then, as far as the lifestyle business continues to be different almost everywhere in the world. But I collectively would say that it's probably down overall, as you would expect. As we've talked about the Footwear business has not been nearly as impacted as the Apparel business, and the lifestyle apparel business has probably been more
impacted than the performance side of that business. So hopefully that answers your question.</font></div>

The outlet business
up and driving higher comp store numbers. And I talked about some of the operational drivers a minute ago.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And then, as far as gross margin guidance is concerned, at this point I wouldn't want to give guidance past this year. We'll certainly get to that as we get into the next couple of quarterly calls.</font></div>

How big is the overall football business? How big should we think about that, and what kind of growth are you seeing there?</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> Well, on a global basis, that market -- the definition of that market gets a little squirrely. But I think, from a performance standpoint, when you look at the overall market place you are probably pushing somewhere between -- you are probably pushing
close to $10 billion at retail, and worldwide, if you include Footwear, Apparel and Equipment.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I think the big opportunity that we see is the opportunity to bring lifestyle to football and vice versa. And you're going to see a very impactful part of our presentation for World Cup as we move closer, including some of the lifestyle components of the business.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> Yes. Well, we are in some ways approaching it in a very traditional sense where our focus is around performance. And some of the new products that you will see launched as we get closer to the event I would just say that I'm very excited about at this
point. And then I think in maybe the non-traditional sense, I think some of the connectivity and activity that we have going on with regards to consumer connectivity both on the ground and digitally will be new and exciting. And so I think you get a chance to see some of that from the NIKE Brand standpoint.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I think, with regards to Umbro, certainly they are focusing most of their efforts around the English team, which by some reports would be believed to be one of the better teams that the English have fielded in quite some time, and there is quite a buzz around that potential opportunity. And I think Umbro is looking to leverage that as a big
part of their approach to World Cup.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

They have a strong performance position, and then of course we are going to be leveraging the sportswear
side of that as well. So I think some sizable opportunity around Umbro as a brand, as a business, leading up to and then through the World Cup.</font></div>

I guess a question for Don, just in looking at the gross margin guidance, how are you thinking about some of these changing dynamics around trade barriers, whether it's Latin America or some of the potential changes in Europe?</font></div>

Certainly, the explicit ones have started to have an impact but not material to NIKE, Inc. I'm using as example such as the Brazilian tariff
on imported footwear. We also always work through delays at customs. And so far, while those things certainly slow us down and do affect some elements of the supply chain, they really have not yet been material.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But as far as just long-term, obviously making sure that we have a free-flowing trade environment is very important to us, and we are in a constant dialogue with various governments around the world to try to maintain that flow.</font></div>

But how about the rest of the world? You've acknowledged some success with the Laguna action performance store. But how are you going to approach the
in-line business, really, going forward?</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> Well, I think -- I'll speak for the NIKE Brand specifically. As we've said, retail will become a bigger and bigger part of our arsenal and our offense. That being said, a healthy marketplace is the most important thing in managing the brand at retail,
and then our ability to bring the brand together in ways that maybe partnership retail is not as equipped to do, we believe, plays a large role in the overall long-term growth of the brand. And so we'll continue to look for locations throughout the world in the key shopping districts, the high-profile locations as well as the high performing locations.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So it's going to continue to be a very important part of what we do.</font></div>

And I will say that our ability to bring all of what we have to bear on the market, on the consumer, has gotten so much better as we've focused on this
direct-to-consumer part of our business. I've said consistently that being a better retailer is going to make us a better wholesale partner and force us to actually elevate our game in some critical pieces of our business. And I can tell you very confidently that the improvements that we are making to make ourselves a better retailer are definitely benefiting our ability to not only manage our own retail but be a better retail partner, better manage the marketplace and really make NIKE a better company.</font></div>
