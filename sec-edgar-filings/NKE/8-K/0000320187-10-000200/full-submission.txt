Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total Revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Mark Parker, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer, NIKE, Inc.:</font> Thanks, Kelly, and happy holidays, everybody. Today's strong results demonstrate the power of our strategies and the exciting opportunities we have across the entire NIKE, Inc. portfolio. We grew almost every area of our business across brands, categories, products and geographies. What fuels this growth is our long-term strategy. It was not short-term in nature. We leverage the same competitive advantages that have driven NIKE growth consistently throughout our history -- putting the consumer first, fixating on innovative product and leveraging the power of our portfolio.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Like any great athlete, we have strong fundamentals. We are able to anticipate and react to opportunity and we stay on the offense. That's what leaders do, stay flexible and balanced, yet also aggressive and aligned to create and leverage opportunity, and that's what we did in Q2. NIKE, Inc. revenue was up 10%, NIKE Brand revenue increased 9%. Revenue for our Affiliates Brands grew 13%. And as a result, we delivered earnings-per-share of $0.94 to our investors. That's up 24% over last year.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The flexibility and power of our portfolio continue to build, and that's a crucial advantage for NIKE. We can really fine-tune how we apply our resources for the greatest return, and we are doing just that across the entire business. We can attack with a single brand like Converse, which just exceeded $1 billion in reported Revenue for the past 12 months, or leverage multiple brands like we do in our action sports business.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We can drive market growth with a single category, like Basketball or Running, where revenue and futures are up double digits. We can expand in key developing markets like China or Russia, which continue to increase revenue, EBIT and futures, and in developed markets like North America, where innovative product, strong brands and great detail presentation are driving solid momentum.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Flexibility gives us options, and that keeps us targeted, aggressive and opportunistic. We are also very focused on balancing our resources against our biggest opportunities. This is especially powerful when we leverage innovation to drive growth. We are creating more opportunity with innovation than ever before. That's true in our products and our categories, and it's true in how we run the business.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Both NIKE Brand Footwear and Apparel continue to accelerate. NIKE Brand Footwear fevenue and futures continue to grow at double-digit rates, and that growth is not based on any single sport or product; it's the result of our category offense and its mix of innovation and key franchises that we used to drive top-line Revenue. In NIKE Apparel, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our performance products, like Pro Combat. You saw this all season in college football, and you can expect to see it expand significantly across multiple sports around the world in the months ahead. That success in performance apparel is behind the growing momentum we see across the entire apparel business. We're delivering innovation to the competitive athlete, and we are taking that performance ethos across to the style side of the business, and that's key t
o being compelling and distinctive in the market.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Innovation also drives how we run the business and how we invest to prepare for long-term success. Sustainability is a great example. We are very active in this space. Lean manufacturing, open source innovation, renewable energy, closed-loop manufacturing -- these are some of the commitments we are making now for the future. We are not waiting. This is good for the planet and it's important to the success of our business. In an increasingly resource-constrained world, the more proactive we are, the more nimble and profitable we become.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">So when I look at our innovation pipeline I see a lot more than footwear and apparel. I see a relentless flow of ideas and opportunities that serve our consumers, our business, our shareholders and our potential, and I'm very proud of what we've done and very excited about what's on the way.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Finally, we have put the consumer at the center of everything we do, and we align ourselves to that consumer. NIKE, Inc. is a company of highly distinctive brands. For us to perform at our best, these distinctions need to be clear and compelling wherever we interact with consumers. When we opened our in-line Converse stores in Boston and New York this quarter, consumers experienced a fully integrated mix of products, brand and storytelling. That's what they expect from us, whether it's in the NIKETown in London, a Cole Haan store in New York or an Action Sports store in California. And we're seeing that commitment to the consumer drive strong sales performance.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This focus on alignment drives two things -- growth in our own retail business and more consistency, innovation and inspiration into our retail partner doors. I've said many times, when we become a better retailer, we become a better wholesaler. I think we are seeing that play out as we continue to align new concepts and experiences and launch them in the marketplace, and we're doing that across the entire business. Looking ahead, we'll continue to do those things that enable today's great results -- listen to the athlete, serve the consumer, stay nimble and aggressively pursue opportunities across the NIKE, Inc. portfolio. It's a powerful equation for profitable, sustainable growth and one that's not going to change.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Near-term, there are some continuing macroeconomic challenges. As supply and demand find a new normal in the recovering economy, our industry is going to experience margin pressure due to rising input costs. While the impact of these cost pressures has been delayed for us, these factors have not diminished. We expect to see these external forces play out for the remainder of the fiscal year.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">However, the same competitive advantages that fuel our long-term growth gives us the leverage we need to help manage the impact of macro forces over the coming quarters.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">You've heard me speak of NIKE's &#8220;complete offense&#8221;, and Q2 is a great example of that offense in action -- strong performance from our brands and categories, great new product for consumers, meaningful events around the world, exciting new retail experiences in-store and online -- and that's the real power of NIKE flexibility, balance and alignment.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Now here's Charlie to take you through the NIKE Brand.</font></div>

I feel great about where we are halfway through the year. Q2 is another example of our ability to align innovative products, brand strength and strong marketplace management to deliver great financial results. But as always, the proof is in the numbers.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Q2 reported revenue for the NIKE Brand grew 9%, or up 10% on a constant dollar basis with higher revenue in every geography except Japan. Constant Dollar futures are up 11% with growth in all seven of our key categories, and our NIKE Direct to Consumer businesses grew double digits, including strong comp store growth in our outlet and in-line stores and the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth online.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our performance in Q2 is not just about the last three months, it's about the last three years and the steps we've taken to grow the market worldwide, creating strong momentum around the brand even in uncertain times. The strategic moves we've made to ensure our strength and leadership serve as catalysts to inspire athletes, expand markets and redefine the consumer experience around the world.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A great example is in North America. I am often asked, how are we able to grow in this developed market? The key is our category offense. Each sport has its unique athletes, cultures and consumers. We are always looking for new ways to connect with them on a deeper, more meaningful level, and we are seeing results across the business, including two of our biggest growth opportunities -- apparel and retail.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our performance apparel, led by innovations like NIKE Pro, continues to drive Revenue and opportunity for the entire apparel business. NIKE Pro is the standard for base layer comfort and sport-specific injury protection. Our uniforms are consistently the lightest, most sustainable and most relevant to the sport, and there is a direct connection between on-field performance and consumer preferences off the field.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We continue to leverage that connection, contributing to great results like we see in the North American business, where Apparel Revenue and Futures increased over 20%. And we're seeing it in retail, and our brand-new Brand Experience stores and in stores operated by our strategic retail partners around the world. That's where we deliver innovation to the athlete, from competition to training to what they want outside the gym. There is still a lot of opportunity to improve and grow in this space, but we are making good progress.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">One quick category example is Running, with its own unique athlete and consumer focus. Our momentum in Running is incredible, and it's something we're very proud of. Running is one of our biggest and most important category of businesses. It's where this brand began and it's a big part of our heritage. One thing we like to do on these calls is point out where we are putting our focus and then update you on our progress.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Well, just over two years ago, when we started to ramp up our new category offense, Running was one of the areas we felt could benefit most. As Mark often mentions, we've amplified our innovation agenda. Our key technologies like Lunar, NIKE Free and Flywire continue to reflect the insights we get from our athletes and consumers.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We're also committed to renewing that passion for the NIKE Brand with the committed Running consumer, putting a lot of that emphasis on young runners and the new running boom that we are fueling around the world. So we set out to create authentic and dramatic experiences for those running consumers. In Q2 alone, we executed 105 events in 28 countries with over 850,000 runners, an all-time record for NIKE. And it all comes together in stores like our Running-only destinations in Stanford, California and Covent Garden in London. And we have transformed over 400 Running retail partner destinations year-to-date. It's a global strategy that we will continue to execute with our direct-to-consumer business, our brand retail partners and especially with the core specialty running shops that serve the serious runner.</font></div>

Our Running Footwear and Apparel products are performing extremely well. Revenue is up double digits and Futures are up and accelerating. I can tell an equally dramatic story around the Basketball business, or even football. Our category focus and execution is how we build and accelerate momentum in a developed market like North America, and we're doing that across the business and around the world. Again, all work in progress, but we certainly like the path we are on.</font></div>

Don will give you the play-by-play on the others in just a few minutes. The Emerging Markets geography is a diverse group and it's becoming more important with each quarter. Markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea are playing a bigger role in the NIKE growth story. We have strong teams on the ground, and they're connecting with consumers, who have a huge appetite for sport and sport lifestyle. That's right in our wheelhouse. It's a model that continues to help the Emerging Markets geography grow even faster than the overall NIKE business, and it's showing up in the results with constant-dollar Revenue up 19% and double-digit Futures growth. I'm sure we'll be talking much more about this in the coming ye

Second, that over the next few quarters we expect to face Gross Margin headwinds along with the rest of our industry but believe those headwinds will ease over the next 12 to 18 months and that we are in the best position to offset their effects. And third, that we will continue to stay focused on driving growth and delivering strong returns to our shareholders.</font></div>

The first key message is about sustainable growth. Our second-quarter results illustrate that our business strategies are resonating with consumers across our brand portfolio and in both developing and developed markets. Consumer sentiment is improving, but not all brands will benefit. Today's consumer is seeking value, broadly defined. They're looking for brands that connect to their lives, deliver innovative products and create compelling presentations wherever they shop. Consumers are picking the winners, and our results demonstrate they are picking NIKE. We believe that, as we drive our strategies around the world we will deliver growth for years to come.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The second key message -- we will face strong Gross Margin headwinds for the next few quarters. The combination of rapidly recovering demand and reductions in supply have driven higher costs for input, such as labor and cotton, as well as higher transportation costs as companies work to meet demand. In addition, uncertainties in the currency markets have strengthened the dollar versus the Euro and the pound. Even so, the strength of our brands and business model give us greater ability to offset these headwinds, and we do expect them to moderate as supply and demand come into balance and as economic fundamentals again drive the currency markets.</font></div>

We're confident in our strategies, and we're going to invest in them to drive revenue. And as we have for the last decade, we will maintain our financial discipline to deliver growth in profits and cash flow, creating value for our shareholders.</font></div>

NIKE, Inc. Revenues increased 10% for Q2 and were 11% higher on a currency-neutral basis. For the NIKE Brand, Revenue grew 10% in constant currency with increases in every category except Sportswear and every geography except Japan. Futures orders grew 11%.</font></div>

The positive drivers were a higher mix of full-priced sales, lower discounts on closeouts and the impact of our product cost reduction initiatives as well as faster growth and higher-margins in our Direct to Consumer businesses. These upsides more than outweighed higher costs for air and ocean freight. The drivers of gross margin were those we expected, although the negative effects of FX and higher input and transport costs were less than what we had anticipated.</font></div>

For the first half of FY 2011 we've delivered $452 million in free cash flow from operations and raised our trailing 12-month ROIC 430 basis points to 21.2%. We're proud of the work we've done to maximize capital productivity, particularly our focus on accounts receivable and inventory. As of November 30, accounts receivable were 3% higher than last year, well below the second-quarter revenue growth. And after six consecutive quarters of decline, inventory at November 30 increased 8%, well below the 11% growth in Futures we reported today.</font></div>

Apparel continues to deliver exceptional growth in North America with currency-neutral Revenues up 22%. Part of that growth is due to the development of new category concepts with retailers such as Foot Locker, Finish Line and Dick's, which have increased apparel space and consumer demand.

Currency-neutral Futures rose 11% even with tough comparisons to the World Cup.

Given the scope and complexity of our product lines and supplier base, changes to input costs do not flow directly and immediately into our product costs, making it difficult for us to call the peak. And while we are working hard with our suppliers to increase capacity, we also expect higher-than-normal levels of air freight, at least through the first half of FY 2012, to meet strong demand.</font></div>

We expect Q4 to be more significantly affected than Q3 as cost pressures intensify and comparisons to the prior year become more challenging. We expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single-digit rate for the year with Q3 growth in the high-single digits and Q4 spending below the prior year as we anniversary heavy investments in the World Cup.

There are a tremendous number of moving parts in gross margins. As we've said, we've had continued success driving costs down. You are very familiar with lean manufacturing initiatives, and we continue to make progress in Footwear and Apparel there and see savings. We've had tremendous benefits coming from shrinking our number of styles in Apparel and making the productivity of that line much more effective. And we have been and we will continue to look at surgical price increases.</font></div>

What we do think is that, as we look forward, we're going to see input costs increase, notably cotton. Labor we talked about. Those are things that we see increasing for a short period of time, call it the next three or four quarters at this stage. And then, as those ease, we think that those long-term benefits of cost reduction initiatives are going to flow through to margin.</font></div>

I don't have the numbers, the breakdowns between the cities here. Maybe we can follow up. But I would expect us to continue to see growth coming out of that expansion. As we reported here, the China numbers continue to be very strong. Our inventories continued to be in pretty good shape there, and we've seen a great appetite from that consumer across some of the key categories, like Basketball, Football and Running.</font></div>

And numbers still very strong, but there's definitely some concern around if there's a slowdown. So I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit more on market share in terms of where you think you are and sort of -- or gains. And is there a number on points of distribution that you could share with us at this point in time?</font></div>

We do a lot of brand strength monitoring as well, which is -- in fact, we see it as almost as -- well, as, actually, probably more important than the actual share numbers.</font></div>

I think you mentioned that you still expect to air freight quite a bit of product.

What is it that you're still chasing from an inventory perspective?</font></div>

And our Direct to Consumer business has been growing pretty rapidly. We also have a lot of at-once business that's also growing very fast.

When you guys reported your first quarter, you just made the observation that the back end of the Futures window was stronger than the beginning of the -- the forward piece of the Futures window. I'm just kind of curious. As you seen overall the mild sequential falloff, constant currency, was there anything unusual in terms of that happened as the quarter progressed, or it's just typical business in terms of flow, cancellations, etc. that happened as the quarter unfolded?</font></div>

So holiday was stronger than fall. And so that's what we were really were referring to in the Futures, the last Futures window. This Futures window is largely going to be the very tail end of holiday and spring, and then the very beginning of summer. And one of the things you've got to bear in mind is that spring and summer particularly are affected by the World Cup comparison.</font></div>

I'm just wondering -- I think you made some comment, maybe you can clarify in terms of what you're seeing on the backlog. I think you mentioned the double-digit growth in the backlog trends.

I think a couple of the things that you've seen recently, the new Kobe shoe came out. We have the emerging talent of Kevin Durant, who is actually becoming a bigger and more effective, I guess, driver of the Basketball business. And then obviously, Lebron and the Jordan Brand.

These are all North America data points. The other thing that we continue to see is a very, very strong appetite for both the sport and the product line in China. And we are starting to see an increasing interest coming out of Western and Central Europe, which has been a little bit of a nice surprise as we've continued to see Basketball become more and more of a global sport.</font></div>

I think it's not necessarily something that you should look at those small windows and believe there's something really that significant in it.

The consolidation work that we did about a year ago has really give us a much stronger platform to grow from, and those partners now are really working to scale up the business.

But when we look at some of the key input costs for us, especially cotton, I think that this past year has been the result of a number of factors. I talked about the fact that when the recession hit and demand was down, a lot of supply came off-line. And then we've had floods in Pakistan and we've had a real explosion in demand. So the combination of those things meant we had a shortage. And I think there's also speculation going on in that market.</font></div>

Can you guys comment at all on the relative momentum by distribution channel? I guess specifically I'd be curious about the family channel and if you are seeing maybe a pickup in your growth there versus the premium channels, where you are already strong.</font></div>

Could you just remind us what the strategy is for the Sportswear business and, you know, why it's down, and then maybe contrast that with the performance apparel business?</font></div>

We don't really -- I think a lot of the time a lot of the industry looks at the channels. We don't consider it the primary lens from which we look at the marketplace and help the marketplace. That being said, we feel very good about our position in all the channels here in North America. I think the ability to segment and position the product line appropriately for each and every one of the different distribution channels has been one of our strengths over a long period of time.</font></div>

So I don't have any of the specifics in front of me, but I would give you an overall perspective in that regard.</font></div>

We reference it, the idea that we can approach a consumer on the field of play, in the gym as they train, and then as part of their lifestyle is certainly an opportunity we believe is a huge competitive advantage for us.</font></div>

The Destroyer jacket, I think the pants -- the Bottoms Bar that we've developed in the women's business is really starting to establish itself, examples like that, the Legend T, iconic pieces like the Tempo shorts in Running and the Basketball Short, are all solid foundational pieces that we put in place around some of our Sportswear business that we expect to continue to see, to both expand and use as an efficient against SKU and style management and productivity.</font></div>

There's been a lot of work done on trying to edit the product line down and amplify the focus on the key styles, some of which Charlie mentioned. So we are seeing some great results in terms of productivity for style, and editing down the product line by 30% or more, actually.</font></div>

But we feel very, very good about the position where we are, both in Footwear and Apparel. I think one thing to keep in mind right now -- our performance business is on fire. It's not, obviously, all used on the field of play. I think some of the Running Footwear that you see out there, both the Lunar and the Dynamic Fit product, as well as the Free product, is taking away some of the numbers from our sports style business, which we are happy to trade back and forth as consumer preferences move back and forth. I think that's one of the big advantages of the NIKE Brand, that we can capture the consumer as they do move back and forth, whether it's a retro style or a new, inno
vative technology, like the Dynamic Fit and Lunar product that's out there today.</font></div>

But I think you're going to see some of that business really starting to pick up again in the later part of this year into early 2012. But over the long term, we are very, very bullish on Sportswear, both in Footwear and in Apparel.</font></div>

But to clarify, have you guys already taken price increases for the back half window? And just given where we are in the year, do you still have flexibility to implement price increases at this point?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

We may have a little bit of flexibility in some of the Emerging Markets business, and we may have a little bit of flexibility on some of the at-once business. But for the most part, most of that product I guess we would have a small amount maybe on the May-June Futures time period, where -- but most of that is represented by the summer product line, which has already been locked in.</font></div>

But it is a market-to-market type situation. What may be working in the US right now doesn't necessarily work in China or Western or Eastern Europe. So it's an ongoing process for us. We feel, actually, very, very good about our ability to be both flexible and aggressive when we can, and we will continue to do so.</font></div>

Can you just talk about what drove that incremental growth?

First of all, on a year-over-your bases there are some timing issues, and we've talked about stock options in the prior calls. We also had a fairly significant number of sales meetings during this particular quarter, which just was a different timing than last year.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">So if you look at last year's phasing, Q2 was the lowest, one of the lowest quarters we've had.

No; I think our consolidation is pretty much complete. I think we were trying to be -- we tried to execute that strategy relatively quickly. Right now, we are actually looking at capacity expansion with our current partners and how fast we can continue to ramp up against the demand that we are seeing.

Can you talk about some of the work that you've done on demand elasticity, especially in Footwear, given your clear market leadership position? How sensitive is consumer demand to pricing when it comes to athletic footwear? Does it vary significantly globally?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">And do you guys think about yourself? We are in an equation right now where the supply and the demand is obviously out of balance, more demand than supply. Do you guys consider yourself on the supply side? And if so -- and your suppliers are seeing a natural lift in their pricing and their cost structure. Shouldn't that flow through, if NIKE is indeed also part of the supply chain?</font></div>

No; I think we would expect to see some price increases across the board. I think -- I guess one of the competitive advantages that we do hold is our portfolio and our ability to manage that across both product types, geographies and categories. But there is a lot of sensitivity to style-by-style, market-by-market situations. And like I said, I'm both very confident and very proud of our ability to manage that continuously. I think we've done a great job of that over the years. I think we have a good process in place that allows us to take advantage of the opportunities when they exist, and we'll continue to do so, as we said. We're looking at a very strong demand curve, some capacity issues, and the ability to take up prices over tim
e. But again, it will be on a surgical basis and you won't see a broad-based application of price increases around the world.</font></div>

So there's definitely some opportunities out there, and we will be looking, taking advantage of those over the next six to 12 months.</font></div>

And then, last question -- there might not be one single answer to this. But regionally, some of the disconnects between the Futures numbers that you are reporting and how some of the sales are flowing through in the following couple of quarters -- Central and Eastern Europe, it seems like the Futures look a little bit stronger than what the flow-through has been versus Emerging Markets, where you guys are just crushing it. And Futures numbers are great, but the actual Revenue numbers you have been reporting are even stronger.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Yes. This is just the conversation we were having earlier. There are quite a few elements of our Revenue equation that are not part of the Futures model. And sales to our wholesale accounts, Footwear and Apparel Futures, are still the primary method by which we sell. But we are increasingly doing, on the margin, Footwear and Apparel at-once. We've got a very rapidly growing Direct to Consumer business, so that varies by geography. There are timing issues specific to geographies. For example, in the emerging world you have a lot of protectionism. Sometimes it takes a while to get through customs.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">So the issue, I think, of trying to match up Futures from one quarter against revenue for one quarter -- that is not necessarily a productive exercise. In the long-term, Futures are a great indicator of business momentum and trajectory.</font></div>
