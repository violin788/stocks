       NIKE REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.24,
                  UP 23 PERCENT FROM PRIOR YEAR

       Worldwide futures orders up 2.9 percent, up 5.4 percent
               excluding effects of foreign currency

Beaverton, OR (March 21, 2006) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
record results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2006.  Third
quarter revenues increased nine percent to $3.6 billion, compared to
$3.3 billion for the same period last year.  Changes in currency
exchange rates reduced revenue growth by three percentage points.  Net
income grew 19 percent to $325.8 million, compared to $273.4 million in
the prior year.  Diluted earnings per share grew 23 percent to $1.24,
versus $1.01 last year.

"We're very pleased with the performance of the Nike brand and our Nike
Inc. portfolio, both for the quarter and year to date," said Mark Parker,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Nike, Inc.   "The strength of our
product pipeline, brand portfolio and global reach is enabling us to
balance continued challenges in markets such as Western Europe and Japan
with strong momentum in other key markets and regions. This, combined
with our ability to manage expenses, enabled us to deliver on our long-
term goal of sustainable, profitable growth." *

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2006 through July 2006,
totaling $5.4 billion, 2.9 percent higher than such orders reported for

impact of currency changes.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased six percent; Europe
(which includes the Middle East and Africa) declined two percent; Asia
Pacific grew five percent; and the Americas increased ten percent.

the increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates.*

1 The Company evaluates performance of individual operating segments
based on pre-tax income.  Total pre-tax income equals Income before
income taxes as shown on the Consolidated Income Statement.

2 "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to total pre-tax
income, which includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the
operating segments for management reporting and intercompany
eliminations for specific items in the Consolidated Income Statement.

* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2006 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously
reported results of operations or shareholders' equity.
