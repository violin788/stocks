Beaverton, OR (March XX, 2004) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
financial results for the Company's third quarter ended February 29,
2004.  Third quarter revenues increased 21 percent to $2.9 billion,
versus $2.4 billion for the same period last year. Third quarter net
income totaled $200.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to
$124.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the prior year.

Philip H. Knight, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "It was
another great quarter for Nike.  Top and bottom line results were again
driven by healthy consumer demand for innovative products and the
strength of Nike's diverse portfolio of businesses. For the first nine
months of the year, Nike's revenue has grown 14 percent and earnings per
share* are up 29 percent.  As we look ahead, we are optimistic about the
significant long-term growth opportunities for our company."**

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery from March 2004 through July 2004, of $4.7
billion, 9.9 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period
last year.  Approximately four points of this growth were due to changes
in currency exchange rates.

By region, futures orders for the USA were up 4.5 percent; Europe grew by
11 percent; Asia Pacific increased 23 percent; and the Americas increased
11 percent.  In Europe, eight points of the increase were due to changes
in currency exchange rates.   Currency exchange rate movements
contributed approximately five points and two points, respectively, to
futures growth in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions.

Knight continued, "Growing consumer demand for Nike footwear and apparel
in our international markets helped drive the 9.9 percent increase in
worldwide futures.   Additionally, we are pleased by the continued
strength of our U.S. business, which recorded its strongest futures
orders growth in eight quarters."**
