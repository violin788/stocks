ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to NIKE's fiscal 2009 second quarter
conference call. For those who need to reference today's Press Release you'll
find it at www.nikebiz.com. Leading today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice
President, Investor Relations.</font></div>

turn the call over to Ms. Catlett let me remind you that participants of this
call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and
those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed
in the reports filed with the SEC including Forms 10-K, 8-K and 10-Q. Some
forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily
indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of
futures and at once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, and
discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

addition it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s
business including equipment, most of NIKE Retail, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan,
Converse, Hurley, and Umbro are not included in these futures numbers. Finally,
participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of
comparable GAAP measures and quantitive reconciliations are found at NIKE's
website. This call might also include discussion of nonpublic financial and
statistical information which is also publicly available on that site,
www.nikebiz.com. Now I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Catlett, Vice
President, Investor Relations.</font></div>

and Happy Holidays everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's
fiscal 2009 second quarter results. As the operator indicated participants on
today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, a comparative presentation
of reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP reported items can be found on our
press release which was issued about an hour ago and can be found at
nikebiz.com. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s CEO, Mark Parker;
followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE brand; and finally will you
hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in depth
review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks we will be
happy to take your questions. Now I will turn it over to NIKE, Inc.'s CEO, Mark
Parker</font></div>

Pam, and good afternoon everybody. Happy Holidays as well. Today you are going
to hear a lot from us so I'll jump right in. You'll hear that we'll be pleased
with our second quarter results and you'll hear caution about the external
environment and confidence in our ability to extend our leadership. What you
will not hear is business as usual. Which is fine with us because NIKE has
really been on the other side of business as usual since we started. It's also
true that strong companies who are able to navigate and leverage tough times
come out even stronger. Our performance in Q2 shows that NIKE's nature and
strength are enviable and competitive advantages.</font></div><br>

know that no one, including NIKE is immune to macro-economic forces. I also know
that Q2 proves we continue to perform even during the compressed adversity that
has surfaced in our global economy over the last few months. I'll leave the
discussion of how we delivered today's results to Charlie and Don. I'm going to
focus on two key questions.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First up,
what's NIKE's outlook and how do we intend to continue to be successful? I
believe that successful companies do a few things exceptionally well. They know
their consumer better than anyone and they connect with them in authentic and
meaningful ways. They create great products that's differentiated by its
innovation, quality and craftsmanship. They create compelling retail
presentations that bring energy and freshness to the consumer experience and
they execute with financial discipline and an unwavering focus on creating
long-term value. These qualities have been at the core of NIKE's success for
over 30 years. Today only magnifies the opportunity we see in front of to us
achieve our true potential.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Does this
mean that nothing has changed? Of course not. But we know that one of the most
consistent competitive advantages we have is our relationship with consumers. In
fact, I'll take that one step further and say, that ultimately it will be
consumers who lead the recovery. I'm completely confident that putting the
consumer first will help lead our Company and our industry to create a stronger
marketplace than we've ever seen.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">You may
say, well, that's all good but what's NIKE doing to respond to short term
challenges in the marketplace? We are going to do what we do best and that's
create innovative product, leverage our consumer connections, and focus on
driving excellence into every corner of our business. We are interested in only
one kind of growth and that's profitable growth. So we'll continue to exercise
caution and discipline on all aspects of our cost structure.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">At the
top of the list are some key influencers that we are laser focused on to
leverage our strength, keep costs in line, and deliver shareholder value. Those
influencers are inventory levels, gross margins, brand strength, developing our
retail capability, and optimizing our SG&amp;A. Demand creation is a big part of
that SG&amp;A.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So where
is that headed? Demand creation is the fuel that drives top line revenue. It
helps attract more consumers, grow the markets where our businesses compete and
increase our share of those markets. At the same time we have tremendous
transparency into our SG&amp;A that we are able to get proactively surgical in
managing those costs. For example we are optimizing the impact of our digital
marketing which is very cost-effective as well as leveraging the investments we
make in our athletes and teams to enhance the way we reach and inspire
consumers.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Will I
give you a decimal point prediction on SG&amp;A? No, but I can tell you we are
moving toward a rate I will call flat plus, which is a good way to discuss our
balance between managing costs and investing in opportunity to generate
profitable growth. In other words, we are very disciplined in managing costs but
will never sacrifice our long-term strength and potential for short-term
savings.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

confident? Absolutely. Are we cautious? Yes. And I'll add one more word to the
mix. Command. I believe we are the industry leader because we have the best
leaders in the industry. And that's across all disciplines, product creation,
marketing, finance, IT, supply chain, really throughout the Company. We are a
team that's fully aligned and committed to managing for consistent and
profitable growth in any and all conditions.</font></div><br>

many times before that I wouldn't trade places with anybody in any industry and
that's never been more true than it is today. I'm not talking about simply
surviving tough times. In fact, it's quite the opposite. I see the current state
of our industry and the world as an incredible opportunity to be a better and
stronger leader, and we are seizing that opportunity. Here's Charlie for an
update on the NIKE Brand.</font></div>

you, Mark. Happy Holidays to everyone. I think Q2 shows you how important it is
to have a strong and compelling brand. If you don't have superior products and a
meaningful relationship with consumers, you're probably hurting right about now.
I've always felt good about the investments we made to create innovative
products and build the brand and am feeling especially good about that now. The
more consistent we are at leveraging these long term competitive advantages the
more effective we'll be at managing through the challenging conditions that we
face today.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So what
do the numbers look like? Well, on a constant dollar basis the NIKE Brand
generated record revenue of $4 billion, up 6%. Global footwear was up 7%, global
apparel was up 6%. Our largest categories, running basketball and sportswear
were all up on the quarter. We plan to gain share in key -- we continue, excuse
me, we continue to gain share in key markets and categories. It was a very
strong quarter where consumer confidence continues to be a concern around the
world.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I'm very
confident that our strength and flexibility will allow to us create even bigger
and sharper separation for the NIKE Brand and we are going to be very strategic
about that. Mark mentioned three important words, confidence, caution and
command. I'm going to add a couple of my own. Connected and competitive.
Somebody asked me the other day, what's the biggest change NIKE needs to make to
continue to grow? And I told them the most important thing we could do is
something we did 18 months ago. And that was to realign the brand into a
consumer driven, category based offense.</font></div>

really looking forward to the upcoming launch of the Zoom Kobe IV, a new mid-cut

the marketplace is a key part of our long-term brand strength. It's especially

aggressive as well as patient. We are working aggressively with our wholesale
partners to present consumer focused and compelling product assortments,
highlighting the brand and providing clear differentiation throughout the

with all our key accounts, managing our sell-throughs, cancellations, futures

being patient here, specifically in direct retail to make sure we are bringing
the right concepts to the right places at the right time. It's fair to say that
current economic conditions are moderating the pace of new store roll-outs for
NIKE but not the pace of refining our concepts and building our skills. Our
focus is on balancing the challenges of the economic landscape with the
opportunity for the brand. There's a lot of leverage and flexibility that comes
out of the supply chain and we have the best in the industry, lean manufacturing
is in place in about 70% of our footwear production, our long-term goal is to
push that to 90%. We continue to consolidate material sourcing and production
capacity and are using our leverage to drive cost objectives into every vendor
relationship. That's not where our supply chain ends. We are tightening up our
buys, giving us more agility all the way through the consumer point-of-sale,
which is a tremendous asset in managing our inventory.</font></div>

the inventory levels we saw some build in Q2, the majority of it is driven by
growth in footwear which is enjoying very strong demand in the marketplace.
Apparel inventories are slightly higher than we would like in Europe and in the
Americas region, but we feel confident in our plans to get them in line over the
next few quarters. There's been a lot of speculation about China inventories.
Which we've managed carefully post-Olympics. We have good transparency into our
retailers&#8217; inventories as well and believe we are in better shape than -- there
than the rest of the industry. As I've noted many times over the year, inventory
management is a critical component to managing a healthy brand.</font></div>

pulling a lot of levers here. But we are not doing it in isolation. Our approach
has always been one of balance. Managing our inventory and managing the
integrity of the brand. Maintaining our strong price value proposition is an
integral part of our long-term strategy.</font></div>

on the brand side, the NIKE brand is as strong as its ever been. It's a
significant advantage in helping us manage the marketplace. We'll continue to
build on the strength and agility of the brand to outperform current conditions
and position NIKE to leverage that recovery. That means putting consumers first,
delivering the best products, telling the best stories, and creating category
best based experiences that no one else can match.</font></div>

word that I mentioned was competitive. No matter where you go in the world the
NIKE brand is a brand that competes successfully at all levels. In the US region
I mentioned running and basketball, where we continue to make solid gains in
market share. We also gained 3 points of overall footwear market share in the
US. Revenue dipped by 1% in Q2 due to softness in apparel and equipment, but
footwear continues to deliver very strong futures orders growth. Futures are up
6% in the US, driven by retailers&#8217; demand for NIKE and Jordan footwear. Retail
comps were down, but we also had our biggest Cyber Monday in history. In fact,
it was our biggest day online yet, up more than 40% over last year.</font></div>

of the US where we look at our business results on a constant dollar basis, the
NIKE brand continues to resonate strongly with consumers around the world. In
our European region, a strong performance in running helped drive revenue up 4%.
Our revenues in the rapidly emerging markets increased 21%. We continue to see
some tough conditions in the UK and Southern Europe where we are working the
levers to manage inventories and maintain our strong brand
position.</font></div><br>

are slightly down which we believe reflect the more difficult environment. Yet
we gained share in major countries throughout the region. Overall, emerging
markets remain solid while our more mature markets remain affected. In Asia
revenue is up 17% including growth in every major country in the region. We
worked really hard in Japan over the last three years to build the brand and
optimize distribution and we are seeing the benefits of that discipline with
revenue growth of 7%. China remains a premiere growth opportunity for the NIKE
brand. Revenue there is up 27% and futures are up 25. Nothing has softened our
enthusiasm for this market or the Chinese consumers and their passion for
sports. We've lightened our lead in brand awareness in China, and now with more
than 4,000 stores in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, we are well-positioned to compete

finally, in the Americas region, football, running and sportswear are leading
the brand across the region, second quarter revenues grew 23%. Futures are up
26%. In Brazil, our largest market in the region, revenues were up 45%, with
growth accelerating during the quarter, as November was a record month for

Charlie, and good afternoon. As my colleagues said to you earlier we are pleased
by the performance of our businesses in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Revenues for the quarter grew 6% to $4.6 billion, with currency changes
contributing about 1 point of that growth. Earnings per share grew 13% to $0.80.
Excluding currency changes NIKE brand revenues grew 6% while revenues for our
continuing other businesses which include Converse, Cole Haan, Hurley and NIKE
Golf grew 3%. The net result of the divestiture of Bauer and Starter and the
acquisition of Umbro was to reduce NIKE, Inc. currency neutral revenue growth by
about 1 percentage point.</font></div>

currency neutral basis, NIKE brand apparel and apparel futures orders scheduled
for delivery from December 2008 through April 2009 grew 6%. We expect real
dollar futures for the period will be down slightly as the US dollar has
strengthened significantly versus most world currencies. Gross margin for the
quarter improved 40 basis points to 44.7%. The growth was primarily due to
foreign exchange hedge gains, product pricing, and mix changes partially offset
by higher apparel closeouts, as well as the lag effect of higher input
costs.</font></div>

growth for the quarter slowed to 8%, with only a minimal impact from currency.
This was below the low to mid-teens growth we projected at the beginning of the
quarter as we took actions to say reduce spending. For the quarter, demand
creation grew 5% while operating overhead grew 10% due largely to infrastructure
investments supporting owned retail and emerging markets, and our fast growing
non-NIKE businesses.</font></div>

interest income in the first quarter was $5 million, $18 million below last year
due primarily to lower interest rates. I'm pleased to say that we have not
sustained any significant investment losses as a result of the turmoil in the
financial markets. Consistent with previous quarters, other income for Q2,
comprised largely of gains and losses on currency hedges, the net impact of
hedge gains and losses, and the impact of currency changes on the translation of
foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses,
increased year over year pretax income by $25 million for the quarter, and $96
million year to date.</font></div><br>

effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, 5.4 points lower than Q2 last

balance sheet and disciplined use of capital are now more important than ever.
For a number of years, maximizing cash flow and returns on capital have been key
areas of focus for us, and we are very proud of the results we've delivered. At
the end of Q2 our cash and short term investments totaled $2.7 billion, or about
$5.57 a share. Net of our outstanding debt of $794 million, that equates to
nearly $4 a share. Our return on invested capital for the 12 months ended
November 30 was 23.3%, 20 basis points below the prior twelve-month period,
primarily due to the positive impact of the one-time tax benefit on the year ago
figure.</font></div>

November 30, our accounts receivable balance increased 5% versus the prior year,
slightly slower than revenue growth for the quarter. We expect some retailers
may face financial difficulties in the coming months, but the strength of our
brand and the consistent focus we've placed on this area over time put us in the
best possible position to minimize any negative impact. Inventories at the end
of the quarter were 9% above the prior year level. Healthy in general but
overall higher than we'd like.</font></div>

of the increase was in NIKE brand footwear, which has continued to perform very
well over the last two quarters and is supported by strong futures bookings.
Accelerated deliveries by factories seeking to maximize capacity utilization and
cash flow, as well as shipping delays related to the transition to our new US
footwear and distribution center, were key drivers of the increase. NIKE brand
apparel inventories grew more slowly and overall accounted for about 16% of the
increase. The transition to direct distribution of apparel in Brazil and higher
inventories in Asia and golf were the largest components of the increase. At
this point we do not believe that these inventory levels represent a material
issue for the balance of the year.</font></div>

last few years we've significantly expanded our factory store network around the
world and are now aggressively moving through excess styles. As transitional
impacts ease and we tighten inventory buying over the balance of the year, we
expect inventory growth to slow over the next two quarters. Now, let's take a

quarter, revenue in the US region declined 1%. Sales to six of our top ten
accounts increased, while two were essentially flat, as NIKE product continues
to perform very well in a difficult environment. Revenues at NIKE-owned retail
stores grew 1% for the quarter, reflecting growth in e-commerce and new store
openings. For the quarter, comp store sales for NIKE-owned inline stores
declined nearly 20%. With limited promotional activity relative to the rest of
the retail marketplace and locations in high tourist areas, these destination
stores were particularly hard hit.</font></div>

footwear revenue increased 1% for the quarter and continues to significantly
outperform the competition in a challenging market. Over the last 12 months,
NIKE and Jordan footwear gained 3 points of market share in the US as consumers
and retailers move increasingly to the strongest brands and the most
differentiated product. Footwear futures for the next five months increased at a
healthy high single-digit rate. US apparel revenues fell 3% for the quarter as
continued weakness in sportswear was partially offset by growth in running and
team apparel. Although we gained apparel market share in the US over the last 12
months, the weakness in apparel reflects the challenging market
environment.</font></div><br>

continued to deliver strong growth as revenues for the quarter grew 27% and

in the short and long-term. We are also pleased with our performance in Japan,
where currency-neutral revenues advanced 7% and we continue to see progress
realizing the enormous potential of that market. For the quarter pretax income
for the Asia region grew 25% due to strong growth in revenues and gross margins

high teens growth at Converse and Hurley more than offset lower revenues at Cole

have continued to grow even as the overall market has softened. Nevertheless, in
this environment we'll be tightening our buys and working hard to move through
inventory quickly and profitably. We'll continue to focus on improving gross
margins, by maximizing leverage in the areas we control such as product cost,
supply chain management, and pricing, while balancing the broader macro-economic
factors such as capacity, currency, energy, and labor costs. And we'll continue
to focus on driving the highest return from our investments in SG&amp;A, both

indicated earlier with slightly different language it's our intention to
significantly slow the growth of SG&amp;A to low single-digit rates or less. As
we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute
with strategic focus and agility. However, we are taking a cautious view of the
overall retail environment, and our expectations for the balance of the year
reflect that perspective. For the second half of the year, we expect revenue to
grow at a low to mid single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis. As we've
seen with our reported futures growth, at current exchange rates reported
revenues would be less. These revenue growth expectations reflect comparisons to
mid-teens revenue growth last year, cancellations, returns, and discounts
broadly in line with current trends and our more conservative inventory buying
plans.</font></div>

anticipate the gross margin for the full year will be essentially in line with
prior year levels, as second half gross margins will likely be lower than the
prior year as we anniversary last year's price increases and actively manage our
inventory levels. While there are many internal and external variables that
drive our revenues and gross margins, we have much greater control of our
SG&amp;A expense. Over the balance of the year, we'll continue to take steps to
reduce spending while shifting resources to fund those initiatives that are
critical to the achievement of our long-term growth goals. We've already
implemented a hiring freeze as well as Company-wide reductions in travel and
meetings. In addition, we are making surgical reductions in other operating
expenses and demand creation. As a result, we expect balance of the year
SG&amp;A to be flat to down reflecting mid-single-digit growth for Q3 and a
double-digit decline for Q4, reflecting lower demand creation and operating
overhead.</font></div><br>

Thank you, hi everybody. And hi, guys, great job in a really tough environment.
Just a couple quick questions. The first is can you give us a little help
understanding what the ASPs look like in the sneaker business both for the
quarter you just reported and then the component of futures orders, maybe
overall globally constant currency if possible and then on the US side of the
business? And then the second question was, just in terms of understanding the
China outlook and comparisons and sort of how you're growing the business over
there? And I think last quarter you mentioned opening some outlet stores over in
China. Can you just give us a little more detail on sort of how China makes out
within this more cautious back half. Thanks.</font></div>

one again?</font></div>

Sorry, the first question was just the ASP component to the US sneaker business
in the quarter and also in the futures outlook, and I guess specifically I was
sort of maybe rough numbers on the, sort of the global ASP outlook for your
footwear business and separately for the US business?</font></div>

right now, Robby, on the quarter and to the futures window, US ASPs up slightly
for us, and futures same way, and then for the global numbers the ASP are down
slightly for both the quarter and the forward futures orders, and that's
basically reflecting a lot of the pricing and value, price-value, actions we've
taken over the last year and a half or so, primarily in the US. And your second
question was about China?</font></div>

Robby, as far as, talking a little bit about just inventory management and the
way we see China right now, I think we are continuing, we've got a few more
outlet stores going in to help us assist in the inventory management. It was
pretty much a planned exercise and we are on plan right now with regards to how
we see it. I think that post-Beijing you've heard a lot about that as we
referenced in the prepared remarks. We feel pretty confident and comfortable
with where we are at. We have great transparency into our retail inventories as
well as our wholesale inventories and I feel really good about the China
business right now. I call out one other thing that I continue to emphasize is I
believe we have the best team on the ground in China, and they have the best
command of the marketplace than anybody else competitively speaking. So we are
still, we are still, we still feel very good about China and its growth
potential.</font></div>

No. The plan will continue pretty much on pace. We have slowed it a little bit

Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I wonder if you can give me an update on
the current promotional environment in Europe, both footwear and apparel?
Particularly Western Europe. Are you experiencing promotions that are basically
stronger than what you had at this time last year? Are promotions likely to
continue to be a factor going forward?</font></div>

Hi, John, this is Charlie. Well, yes, the answer to the question would be yes,
the promotional conditions are certainly a little bit more robust than they were
at this time last year. We've seen that primarily across Southern and --
Southern Europe, Southern France, Italy, Spain. We have seen some increased
activity in the UK. And I think you're pretty much well aware of that. I would
expect this promotional activity to continue through the first half of calendar
'09.</font></div>

Well, it's a little bit more intense. I think we've been, we've seen it, we've
seen it start in Southern Europe, we talked a little bit about it, I think on
the last call where Spain and Italy had softened a little bit and you started to
see it.&#160;&#160;And then I think things in the UK have certainly gotten a lot
more promotional in the last 90 days.</font></div>

promotional activity increasing there as well?</font></div>

Well, Russia had a very strong quarter, extremely strong, and we feel real good
about the brand position in Russia. I think as everybody knows, the Russian
financial circumstances have been as dramatic as any, and so we are keeping a
cautious watch on what's going on with regards to both consumer confidence and
buying trends. So overall, still very, very bullish on the long-term, the
outlook, but certainly as we've seen some of the deterioration in the financial
markets. Russia has been hard hit and we really don't know consumer-wise how
that's going to be affected as we look forward into the next two

Well, right now Europe overall is still our, probably our biggest challenge
inventory-wise. I think we called that out also in the prepared remarks. We feel
confident that we are able maintain the management of that. That would be pretty
consistent with Russia as well. And I think that when you think about the
overall European landscape it is a little bit of tale of two cities. Western
Europe certainly a little bit more impacted currently, and the emerging markets
continue to provide some pretty good growth for us.</font></div><br>

Thank you. Just going back to China quickly, are you hearing about excess
inventories needing to be cleared out at any of your competitors and if so are
you starting to see more competitive pricing in the market? And of that build,
if there is any build, is it more Olympics related product?</font></div>

Hi, Kate, this is Charlie. Well, the answer is yes and yes. That we have started
to see additional and hear of additional inventory and we are starting to see a
little bit more of a promotional environment. I think some of it is related to
Olympics product but I think it's also a carry over just in overall inventory
situation coming out of Olympics and I think it's something that we are actually
very sensitive and conscious to. Like I said earlier, the transparency we have
into our retail inventories is probably as strong in China as it is anywhere
else in the world because of the Mono brand retail format and we feel very good
about our ability to manage through it.</font></div>

holidays. I guess the first question for Mark, when you look at the overall
trends of the business and trends of the futures I guess can you talk a little
bit about your expectation in terms of the deceleration? Is this the start of
what you see as a major deceleration for the industry? And I guess can you
elaborate a little bit more on the trend from November into December around the
business and were there major inventory cancellations that you guys
had?</font></div>

we, I get this question probably a few times a day from people inside and
outside the Company, is how long is this going to last, where are we in this
cycle, really hard to say. And I think, though, that, I wouldn't say the worse
is behind us and we certainly are not planning with that assumption in mind. As
Don said, I tried to cover in some of my opening remarks, is we are much more
cautious just about where we are in terms of managing and scenario planning
around the business. So we are pulling in expenses, expense management,
tightening up where we think it's appropriate. But also trying to balance that
out with being appropriately opportunistic and really leading on the things that
we look at as important competitive advantages. So how do we leverage and
amplify those at this time? But I wouldn't say, I'm not going to sit here, I
think it would be cavalier of me to say that this is a short term
situation.</font></div>

other hand, how long it is? I really don't know. I mean, I can't say. And I'm
not sure anybody is going to put themselves out there and try to predict any
sort of data on this. We are moving forward and planning our business as if the
situation is going to be around for awhile. And planning and managing expenses
and investments appropriately.</font></div>

the question I have is the trends of the business in November and sort of what
you've seen thus far in December, maybe the NikeTown trends but also are you
seeing or have you seen any major inventory cancellations throughout the various
regions of the business?</font></div>

we haven't seen a worsening situation as we look at November going into
December; maintaining somewhat of a balance I think from the November period
into December. Certainly not, it's a week by week situation. We look at this
every day. But we are not seeing any major cancellations in the business, no
major red flags or signs that this situation is worsening. But obviously it's
something that we are going to continue to keep a very close reign on and again
manage the business appropriately. But I'm sitting here today not seeing a
worsening situation as we move from November to December. But again that said,
we are going to be managing very cautiously and conservatively as we move
through the next two quarters.</font></div>

Bob, just to make one other point that Mark mentioned as well, this is a day by
day, market unit by market unit, type of activity here. One of the things that I
think we are all seeing is tremendous volatility and very uneven aspect to this.
We have got markets that are still continuing to grow very strongly. We have
markets that are under a bit more pressure. And the way we need to manage that
as we always do is market by market, day by day, account by account, and I think
we feel very confident that we have got the teams in place that can do
that.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

just add quickly, one of the competitive advantages that we look at and try to
amplify particularly in periods of time like this is marketplace management. We
have got a very close handle on some of the key measures that really are
important to the business. Obviously inventory management, margin management,
cancellations, sell throughs, any debt issues, accounts receivable and how we
manage that. We have a very strong, tight relationship with our key accounts and
we manage those, look at those numbers and that dashboard very carefully day in,
day out, weak in, weak out. And again, I feel like we are in a better position
there than most, great cash position, good liquidity, strong balance sheet. So,
and that's what we intend to continue to see for the business.</font></div><br>

And then the second part of my question is on inventories. Would it be possible
to give us inventory by region, Don? And I guess the question that I have
specifically asked another way on China is can you give us an inventory
increased number in China at the end of the quarter?</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

have it that way, Bob, top of mind but what I can tell me you is the DII, the
days in inventory in China is actually 62 days. So our average days in inventory
for the Company is around 100 plus or minus. China actually is about 62 right
now and that's not the highest DII we've e seen in that market in the last 12
months. There's been an ebb and flow in the marketplace. We've seen some
improvement over a couple of months and then it pops up and down a little bit
but in an aggregate level it's a lot lower in China, that's one of our most
efficient markets from an inventory standpoint that we have in the
Company.</font></div>

had some increase in delays in shipping related to the opening of our new
distribution center in Memphis. So that was one of the components. Certainly
retail was an element that affected the growth rate as I had discussed on my
prepared remarks, retail was up 1% the rest of the business was up more. We did
see a little bit higher cancellation rate. On the other hand there were
offsetting factors in the other direction. The biggest drivers on that I would
say is probably the retail piece and the footwear deliveries.</font></div>

then a potential bright side to this whole slowdown here, we've seen easing
commodity costs, from a product costing standpoint can you speak to the timing

First of all I want to put it in the context that we've talked about many time.
There's a tremendous number of moving parts in our gross margin equation,
currencies, commodities, product mix, design, any number of different factors.
There is a lag effect for a lot of these. We talk about roughly a twelve-month
lag on foreign exchange. On the product cost, commodity cost front it's probably
more like a two quarter, six-month or so lag. So one of the things that you
should also bear in mind is neither of these is a direct translation of spot
rates into product cost. We hedge currency. We don't hedge commodities but

tell you is, you're on about a six-month lag or so on commodity prices and it's
not a direct translation into product cost. But the context I want to make sure
I put around this is we have a lot of levers that we do control. We can't
necessarily dictate the price of oil or the euro/dollar exchange rate but
there's a lot of levers we have in terms of how we design product, how we run
our supply chain and our goal is to continue to try to maximize margin to the
extent we can and deal with the macros as they come.</font></div><br>

good afternoon. Mark, wanted to follow-up on some of your comments at the
beginning. It seemed, it was pretty interesting to hear you kind of open up with
some discussions around expense management and maybe thinking about some of
those line items more strategically and surgically, I think you used that word.
Wanted to get you to maybe elaborate on that flat plus term you through out
there, but also just in the context philosophically thinking about your business
globally how you create demand, how you invest, how you decide which
opportunities to invest in and which ones may not be as high a return in
opportunity, is there a little bit of a shift there in terms of the way
management thinks about it? We are under the assumption that these are
unprecedented times? And also, are you seeing any changes in terms of the
pricing out there for some of these marketing assets just given the global
slowdown, a lot of corporation that have been heavily invested in sports you get
pulling back, any thoughts around there, too, would be helpful.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font> Yes,
first of all, I thought really putting the emphasis, more emphasis than normal
on expense management here is particularly appropriate at this time and I don't
need to explain why that is. I think we are being appropriately cautious in our
spending. This outlook for the next couple of quarters and going into fiscal '10
is probably less clear for everybody at this stage. So it's really important for
us I think to manage our expenses even more sharply than I think we have. And
I've said many times before that the opportunity we have is to make sure that we
are focused on the biggest return, highest impact opportunities and that means
both topline in terms of where we focus on revenue generating opportunities but
also in our expenses and how we manage our expenses. Where can we cut back and
not see a significant increase or impact on the business in a negative way. And
frankly, that's something I think any company should be doing any time anyway.
This is like I said an opportunity to get even sharper in that respect and as I
said we are not going to miss that opportunity.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So
there's a lot of scrutiny and surgical was a word I used and I do use that word
a lot off these calls, too, internally. Anybody can tell you that. I think where
we are at this stage is to really make sure that both top line and expenses
moving to bottom line that we are surgical and appropriately opportunistic as
possible. So that certainly includes our expense management piece.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

feel like we are as tightly managing our financial situation as we ever have in
our history as a Company. And I mean that in a good way. We are trying to make
sewer that we are balancing that with not losing this opportunism that I think
has made NIKE what it is today at the same time and making sure that the
expenses that we are focused on are those or the investments that we are making
are those that help us realize even greater potential going forward. If that
means we are going to have to tighten up expenses in certain areas to make room
for those investments that are going to be again most critical.</font></div>

the demand creation spend, that's certainly a part of the scrutiny around our
expense management, our SG&amp;A, looking at demand creation obviously is one of
the bigger sources of spending we have, so we are looking at all aspects of
demand creation.</font></div><br>

the category offense that we like to talk about and I'm as equally bullish on
the advantages and the strides we've taken over the last 12, 18 months as a
Company to be more competitive in each of the discrete pieces of our business
but one of the good benefits, the side effects is that we are able to really be
more surgical in our demand creation spend to realize higher impact on that
spend by getting sharper and better connected by to the consumer, to those key
retailers by category. But we are looking at all that. That includes sports
marketing to your question.</font></div>

those assets be coming down significantly in value? I can't say. I would imagine
that there will be some impact that we'll be seeing in the months and quarters
ahead. I can't imagine frankly, that it's going to be business as usual in that
department. And we are seeing signs of that already. So there's opportunities
here. Again, I think if we are smart, in terms of where we are spending to try
to generate the biggest impact on the return side we are going to see some good
opportunities ahead and that includes demand creation in sports marketing as
well.</font></div>

afternoon, Happy Holidays everybody. A couple questions. Number one, when you

Sam, make sure I understood your question much the guidance we gave on SG&amp;A
was balance of year guidance, we said flat to down for balance of the year on
SG&amp;A.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Sam Poser&gt;:</font>
Correct.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

on gross margin, we said for the full year roughly in line with last year and
that means the second half would be down.</font></div>

      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Sam Poser&gt;:</font>
Correct. Understood. Okay. And then in, on your balance sheet you showed a large
increase in the prepaid expense and other. Can you tell us or give us a little
bit -- some detail on why that jumped so much?</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A - Don Blair&gt;:</font> Sure.
There is a couple of line items on the balance sheet, that's one of them. That
reflect the gains and losses on our derivative portfolio which is the hedges on
currency. And that prepaid increase relates to that and one of the things we had
said on an earlier call was that we had taken the opportunity before the
significant weakening of the euro to push our hedging time lines out further.
And so what you are seeing on the balance sheet now is a reflection of that
strategy.</font></div><br>

visibility.</font></div>

I think the visibility we have to what's going on in the marketplace in terms of
our relationships with our retailers and whatnot is actually never been better.
The larger macro global economic visibility is really the big question
obviously. And I have never seen a time where it's been as muddy as it is today.
We are seeing lots of ripple effects coming in. When is the last ripple to start
to turn the corner? We don't know. I think that's the big question of the
day.</font></div>

would just add a couple things to that in a sense that I've been around this
thing for a long time. I think to Mark's point the external macro conditions are
certainly significant and probably as big as anything we've ever seen, but our
goal has always been to outperform those macro conditions and I think that's
something that we continue to be committed to.</font></div>

with our brand strength, our product pipeline, the consumer connectivity that we
have, we have an opportunity to really leverage those as competitive advantages
in a marketplace like this. So that the, I guess the clarity of vision is not as
much a concern to us as much as the excitement that we have around our ability
to operate even in these conditions and the advantages we have and I think those
are advantages that we've been able to build over the last several years as well
as ever since we've been around.</font></div>

think it's a -- I think we sounds cautious but we also sound optimistic and we
may look back on this year as maybe being one of the most satisfying years we've
actually had because we feel the way that the tools that we have to operate in
these types of conditions we may be better equipped.</font></div>

just add quickly that the tone around here at NIKE is one of, this is an
opportunity. And I don't mean that we are cavalier about what's going on or feel
immune to the situation, by no means is that the case. But I think there's a
true feeling, like this is an opportunity for NIKE to be even a better Company
and to leverage some of those things that we've built as competitive strengths
through our history as a Company. So this is an opportunity I think for us in
the months ahead, and the quarters ahead, to get even better.</font></div>
