Item 5.02     Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of
              Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.

On November 18, 2004, the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (the
"Company") appointed William D. Perez as President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company and as a director of the Company, effective on
December 28, 2004.  Philip H. Knight, co-founder and current Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, will continue as Chairman of
the Board and remain active in the Company.  Mr. Perez will report
directly to the Board of Directors.  The Company anticipates that Mr.
Perez will serve on the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.

William D. Perez, age 57, has been President and Chief Executive Officer
of S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc., a global consumer products company with
such brands as Windex, Ziploc, Pledge, Glade, and Saran, since 1996.
Mr. Perez joined S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc. in 1970, and has held a
number of senior positions in marketing, regional management, and global
management, becoming President and Chief Operating Officer of Worldwide
Consumer Products in 1993.  Mr. Perez is also a director of Kellogg
Company, where he serves on the Audit Committee and the Consumer
Marketing Committee.

The Company and Mr. Perez have entered into an employment agreement, a
copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.  Under the terms of this
agreement, on December 28, 2004, Mr. Perez will receive (i) an initial
stock option for 200,000 shares of Company stock with a fair market
value exercise price, a ten-year term and vesting one-third per year
over three years, and (ii) an initial restricted stock bonus for 100,000
shares of Company stock vesting one-third per year over three years.
Mr. Perez will receive an initial annual salary of $1,350,000, target
bonuses under the Company's annual Performance Sharing Plan of 125% of
salary, annual option grants of at least 150,000 shares, annual
restricted stock bonus awards of at least $2,000,000 of Company stock,
and annual $600,000 target awards under the Company's three-year long-
term incentive programs.  He will also participate in other employee
benefit programs available to executives of the Company.  He is
guaranteed a bonus of at least $703,125 for the remainder of fiscal
2005.  In July 2005, he will receive special target awards under the
Company's long-term incentive plan of $600,000 for a two-year
performance period and $283,000 for a one-year performance period.  If,
on or prior to December 28, 2007, Mr. Perez's employment is terminated
by the Company without cause or by Mr. Perez for good reason, he will
receive a severance payment equal to two years' salary plus at least one
year's target annual bonus, and will have vesting accelerated on his
initial stock option and restricted stock awards.  If Mr. Perez's
employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Perez
for good reason after December 28, 2007, he will receive a severance
payment equal to two years' salary.

Item 5.03     Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change
              in Fiscal Year.

On November 18, 2004, the Board of Directors approved amendments to the

                           ARTICLE 1 - Offices

     Section 1.  Principal Office.  The registered office and principal
                 ________________
executive offices of NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Corporation"),
shall be located in Beaverton, Oregon, or such other location as the Board of
Directors may determine.

     Section 2.  Additional Offices.  The Corporation may also have offices at
                 __________________
such other places, either within or without Oregon, as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine or as the business of the Corporation may
require.


                         ARTICLE 2 - Shareholders

     Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of the shareholders of the
                 _________________
Corporation shall be held at Beaverton, Oregon, or any other place, either
within or without Oregon, selected by the Board of Directors, or in the
absence of a selection by the Board of Directors, by the Chairman of the
Board.

     Section 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the shareholders
                 _______________
shall be held on the third Monday in September of each year if not a legal
holiday, and if a legal holiday then on the next succeeding business day, at
such time as may be designated by the Board of Directors and specified in the
notice of the meeting.  The Board of Directors shall have the discretion to
designate a different annual meeting date for any year, provided that the date
so designated is within 60 days of the date specified in the preceding
sentence.  At the annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect by vote a Board
of Directors, consider reports of the affairs of the Corporation, and transact
such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

     Section 3.  Special Meetings.  The Corporation shall hold a special
                 ________________
meeting of shareholders upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, the
President or the Board of Directors, or if the holders of at least 10 percent
of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the
special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary of the Corporation one
or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose or purposes for
which it is to be held.  Special meetings of the shareholders may not be
called by any other person or persons.


     Section 4.  Notice of Meetings and Waiver.
                 _____________________________

     (a)     General.  The Corporation shall notify shareholders in writing of
             _______
the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders meeting not
earlier than 60 days nor less than ten days before the meeting date.  Except
as otherwise required by applicable law, the Corporation is required to give
notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.  Such notice is
effective when mailed if it is mailed postage prepaid and is correctly

                                   1
addressed to the shareholder's address shown in the Corporation's current
record of shareholders.  Except as otherwise required by applicable law,
notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.  Notice of a special meeting shall
include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called.

     (b)     Adjourned Meetings.  If an annual or special shareholders meeting
             __________________
is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of
the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the
meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is
fixed, or is required by law to be fixed, notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.  A
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
shareholders meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless
the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the
meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the
original meeting.

     (c)     Waiver of Notice.  A shareholder's attendance at a meeting waives
             ________________
objection to (i) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the
shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting, and (ii) consideration of a particular
matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in
the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter
when it is presented.

     Section 5.  Quorum.  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group
                 ______
may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares
exists with respect to that matter.  Unless otherwise required by law, a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group
constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.  Once a
share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for
quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of
that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned
meeting.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of those present in person or
represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum
exists.  Any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting
may be transacted at the adjourned meeting if a quorum exists.

     Section 6.  Voting Rights.  The voting rights of holders of stock of the
                 _____________
Corporation, and the circumstances under which any class of stock has special
voting rights and the manner of exercise thereof, are as set forth in the
Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Restated Articles").
Only shares of stock are entitled to vote.  Except as otherwise provided in
the Restated Articles or by applicable law:  (i) each outstanding share,
regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a
shareholders meeting; (ii) if a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than
the election of directors, by a voting group shall be approved if the votes
cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within
the voting group opposing the action; and (iii) directors shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes cast by holders of the shares entitled to vote in the
election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

     Section 7.  Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.  If the name signed on a
                 ___________________________________
vote, consent, waiver or proxy corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the
Corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the vote, consent,

                                   2
waiver or proxy and give it effect as the act of the shareholder.  If the name
signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy does not correspond to the name of
its shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless
entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy and give it effect as
the act of the shareholder if authorized by ORS 60.237 or any successor
provision dealing with acceptance of votes.

     Shares of the Corporation are not entitled to be voted if (i) they are
owned, directly or indirectly, by another domestic or foreign corporation, and
(ii) the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares
entitled to be voted for the directors of such other corporation.  This
paragraph does not limit the power of a corporation to vote any shares,
including its own shares, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

     Any redeemable shares that the Corporation may issue are not entitled to
be voted after notice of redemption is mailed to the holders and a sum
sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company
or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the
holders the redemption price on surrender of the shares.

     Section 8.  Proxies.  A shareholder entitled to vote or to execute any
                 _______
waiver or consent may do so either in person or by written proxy duly executed
and filed at or before the meeting at which it is to be used with the
Secretary at the Corporation or other officer or agent of the Corporation
authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment of a proxy is effective when
received by the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation
authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a
longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form.  An appointment
of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form
conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled
with an interest.

     Section 9.  Shareholder Lists.  After fixing a record date for a meeting,
                 _________________
the Corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all of its
shareholders who are entitled to notice of the meeting.  The list shall be
arranged by voting group, and within each voting group, by class or series of
shares and show the address of and the number of shares held by each
shareholder.  The shareholder list shall be available for inspection by any
shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting for which
the list was prepared is given and continuing through the meeting.  Such list
shall be kept on file at the Corporation's principal office or at a place
identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held.
A shareholder, or the shareholder's agent or attorney, shall be entitled on
written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of law, to copy the
list during regular business hours and at the shareholder's expense during the
period it is available for inspection.  The Corporation shall make the
shareholder list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, or the
shareholder's agent or attorney, is entitled to inspect the list at any time
during the meeting or any adjournment.  The original stock transfer book shall
be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to inspect
such list or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.  Refusal or failure to
prepare or make available the shareholder list does not affect the validity of
action taken at the meeting.

                 _________
upon the death, resignation or removal of any director or upon an increase in

result of death, resignation or removal from office of a director who is
elected by a separate class vote of the common stock, it shall be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors similarly
elected by such class.  If none shall be remaining, the vacancy shall be
filled by all directors then in office.  If the directors remaining in office
constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board, they may fill the vacancy by an

meeting, each of the directors not present shall sign a written waiver of
notice, or consent to holding such meeting, or an approval of the minutes
thereof.  All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the
corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.  A director's
attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the
director of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting,

the meeting, (ii) the director's dissent or abstention from the action taken
is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or (iii) the director delivers
written notice of dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the
meeting before its adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after
adjournment of the meeting.  The right of dissent or abstention is not
available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.

     Section 9.  Compensation.  Directors shall be entitled to such
                 ____________

compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of Directors,
including, without limitation, an annual fee, a fixed sum for attending each
Board and committee meeting, and their expenses of attendance at each meeting
of the Board or a committee.  No such payment shall preclude any director from

               ARTICLE 8 - Transactions With Interested Directors

     Section 1.  Validity of Transaction.
                 _______________________
     (a)     No transaction involving the Corporation shall be voidable by the
Corporation solely because of a director's direct or indirect interest in the
transaction if:

            (i)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's
interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of
the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors or committee authorized,
approved or ratified the transaction;

           (ii)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's
interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and the
shareholders authorized, approved or ratified the transaction by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Corporation, or by written consent; or

(iii) The transaction was fair and reasonable to the Corporation.

     (b)     This Article 8 shall not invalidate any contract, transaction or
determination that would otherwise be valid under applicable law.

     Section 2.  Indirect Interest.  Solely for purposes of this Article 8, a
                 _________________
director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if
another entity in which the director has a material financial interest or in
which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or the
transaction with another entity of which the director is a director, officer
or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be
considered by the Board of Directors.

     Section 3.  Authorization by Board.  For purposes of Section 1 of this
                 ______________________
Article 8, a transaction in which a director has an interest is authorized,
approved or ratified by the Board of Directors if it receives the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors, or on the
committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction.  A
transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this Article 8
by a single director.  If a majority of the directors who have no direct or
indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the
transaction, a quorum shall be present for the purpose of taking action under

                                  12
this Article 8.  The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct
or indirect interest in the transaction shall not affect the validity of any
action taken under Section 1 of this Article 8 by the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or
ratified as provided in Section 1 of this Article 8.

     Section 4.  Authorization by Shareholders.  For purposes of Section 1 of
                 _____________________________
this Article 8, a transaction in which a director has an interest is
authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote under this Article 8 voting as a single voting group.
Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or
indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the
control of any entity described in paragraph (a) of Section 2 of this Article
8 may be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize,
approve or ratify a transaction by vote of the shareholders under Section 1 of
this Article 8.  A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are
entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this Article 8
constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this Article 8.


                          ARTICLE 9 - Indemnification

     (a)     The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any person who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to or
witness in, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative, or otherwise (including any action, suit or proceeding by or in
the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that:

           (i)  the person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries;

          (ii)  the person is or was serving as a fiduciary within the meaning
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to any
employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or

         (iii)  the person is or was serving, at the request of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as a director or officer, or as a
fiduciary of an employee benefit plan, of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     (b)     The Corporation may indemnify its employees and other agents to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

     (c)     The expenses incurred by a director or officer or other
indemnified person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative, or otherwise, which the director or officer is made or
threatened to be  made a party to or witness in, or is otherwise involved in,
shall be paid by the Corporation in advance upon written request if the
indemnified person:

           (i)  furnishes the Corporation a written affirmation that in good
faith the person believes that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation; and

          (ii)  furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking to repay such
advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.  Such advances
shall be made without regard to the person's ability to repay such expenses


                                  13
and without regard to the person's ultimate entitlement to indemnification
under this Article or otherwise.

     (d)     The rights of indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be
in addition to any rights to which a person may otherwise be entitled under
any articles of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, statute, policy of insurance,
vote of shareholders or Board of Directors, or otherwise; shall continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation; and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such person.

     (e)    Any repeal of this Article 9 shall be prospective only and no
repeal or modification of this Article 9 shall adversely affect any right or
protection that is based upon this Article 9 and pertains to an act or
omission that occurred prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

     (f)     As a condition precedent to indemnification under this Article 9,
not later than 30 days after receipt by the director or officer of notice of
the commencement of any proceeding the director or officer shall, if a claim
in respect of the proceeding is to be made against the Corporation under this
Article 9, notify the Corporation in writing of the commencement of the
proceeding.  The failure to properly notify the Corporation shall not relieve
the Corporation from any liability which it may have to the director or
officer otherwise than under this Article 9.  With respect to any proceeding
as to which the director or officer so notifies the Corporation of the
commencement:

            (i)     The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the
proceeding at its own expense.

           (ii)     Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), the
Corporation may, at its option and jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified and electing to assume such defense, assume the defense of
the proceeding, with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the director or
officer.  The director or officer shall have the right to use separate legal
counsel in the proceeding, but the corporation shall not be liable to the
director or officer  under this Article 9 for the fees and expenses of
separate legal counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its
assumption of the defense, unless (A) the director or officer reasonably
concludes that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation and
the director or officer in the conduct of the defense of the proceeding, or
(B) the Corporation does not use legal counsel to assume the defense of such
proceeding.  The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of
any proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to which the
director or officer has made the conclusion provided for in (A) above.

          (iii)  If two or more persons who may be entitled to indemnification
from the Corporation, including the director or officer seeking
indemnification, are parties to any proceeding, the Corporation may require
the director or officer to use the same legal counsel as the other parties.
The director or officer shall have the right to use separate legal counsel in
the proceeding, but the Corporation shall not be liable to the director or
officer under this Article 9 for the fees and expenses of separate legal
counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of the requirement to use
the same legal counsel as the other parties, unless the director or officer
reasonably concludes that there may be a conflict of interest between the
director or officer and any of the other parties required by the Corporation
to be represented by the same legal counsel.

           (iv)     The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify the
director or officer under this Article 9 for any amounts paid in settlement of
any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be

                                  14
unreasonably withheld.  The director or officer shall permit the Corporation
to settle any proceeding that the Corporation assumes the defense of, except
that the Corporation shall not settle any action or claim in any manner that
would impose any penalty or limitation on the director or officer without such
person's written consent.

     (g)     Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 9, the Corporation
shall not be obligated under this Article 9 to make any indemnification or
advance any expenses in connection with any claim made against any director or
officer:

           (i)  for which payment is required to be made to or on behalf of
the director or officer under any insurance policy, except with respect to any
excess amount to which the director or officer is entitled under this Article
9 beyond the amount of payment under such insurance policy;

          (ii) if a court having jurisdiction in the matter finally
determines that such indemnification is not lawful under any applicable
statute or public policy;

         (iii) in connection with any proceeding (or part of any proceeding)
initiated by the director or officer, or any proceeding by the director or
officer against the Corporation or its directors, officers, employees or other
persons entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation, unless: (A) the
Corporation is expressly required by law to make the indemnification; (B) the
proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors; or (C) the director or
officer initiated the proceeding pursuant to subsection (i) of this Article 9
and the director or officer is successful in whole or in part in such
proceeding; or

          (iv) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale by
the director or officer of securities of the Corporation within the meaning of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or similar provision of any state statutory
law or common law.

     (h)     In the event of payment under this Article 9, the Corporation
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of the director or officer.  The director or officer shall execute
all documents required and shall do all acts that may be necessary to secure
such rights and to enable the Corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce
such rights.

     (i)     Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all
rights to indemnification and advances to directors and officers under this
Article 9 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the
same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation and
the director or officer.  Any director or officer may enforce any right to
indemnification or advances under this Article 9 in any court of competent
jurisdiction if: (i) the Corporation denies the claim for indemnification or
advances, in whole or in part, or (ii) the Corporation does not dispose of
such claim within 45 days of request therefor.  It shall be a defense to any
such enforcement action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
advancement of expenses pursuant to, and in compliance with, this Article 9)
that the director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9.  However, except as provided in subsection (f) of this Article 9,
the Corporation shall not assert any defense to an action brought to enforce a
claim for advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article 9 if the director
or officer has tendered to the Corporation the affirmation and undertaking
required hereunder.  The burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that indemnification is not appropriate shall be on the Corporation.  Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the

                                  15
commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because the director or officer has met the applicable standard
of conduct nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors or independent legal counsel) that indemnification is improper
because the director or officer has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be asserted as a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9 or otherwise.  The director's or officer's expenses incurred in
connection with successfully establishing such person's right to
indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in any proceeding shall also
be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation.

     (j)     The rights conferred on any person by this Article 9 shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

     (k)     To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation, upon
approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any
person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article 9.

     (l)     If this Article 9 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on
any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full extent not
prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article 9 that shall not have
been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.


                 ARTICLE 10 - Limitation of Director Liability

     To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation
shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary
damages for conduct as a director.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if the Oregon Revised Statutes are amended, after this Article 10
becomes effective, to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors of the Corporation, then the
liability of directors of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the Oregon Revised Statutes, as so amended.
No amendment or repeal of this Article 10, nor the adoption of any provision
of these Bylaws inconsistent with this Article 10, nor a change in the law,
shall adversely affect any right or protection that is based upon this Article
10 and pertains to conduct that occurred prior to the time of such amendment,
repeal, adoption or change.  No change in the law shall reduce or eliminate
the rights and protections set forth in this Article 10 unless the change in
the law specifically requires such reduction or elimination.

EXHIBIT 10.1



                             WILLIAM D. PEREZ
                             ________________

                            TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT
                            ___________________



1.     Effective Date.
       ______________

       Your employment will commence on December 28, 2004.

2.     Position.
       ________

     President and Chief Executive Officer of Nike, Inc. reporting to
the Nike Board of Directors.  In addition, you will be appointed to the
Board of Directors of Nike upon commencement of your employment and
subsequently stand for election at Nike's annual shareholder meeting in
September 2005.

3.     Base Salary and Performance Sharing Plan.
       ________________________________________

     Your initial base salary shall be $1,350,000 per year.  In
addition, you will be eligible for an annual bonus payable in August of
each year under Nike's Performance Sharing Plan (PSP).  Your target
bonus will equal 125% of your fiscal year base earnings, with the
performance measure being based on achievement of Nike, Inc. pre-tax
income goals.  Your fiscal 2005 base earnings will equal five months'
salary, or $562,500, and, in addition, your fiscal year 2005 bonus,
while not technically covered by the PSP, will be on the same terms as
the 2005 PSP awards to other executives except that you will be
guaranteed a payout of at least 100% of the target rate or $703,125
(125% of $1,350,000 = $1,687,500 multiplied by 5/12 of a year =
$703,125).  Your actual bonus award can increase up to 150% of your
target rate in the event Nike exceeds its pre-tax income goals.

4.     Annual Stock Grants.
       ___________________


       a.     Stock Options
              _____________

         You will be eligible to receive an annual stock option grant
     under Nike's Stock Incentive Compensation Plan beginning with the
     fiscal 2006 grant cycle, subject to Plan rules and final approval
     by the Nike Board of Directors.  Annual grants are traditionally
     made in July, thus July 2005, would be your first annual grant
     date.  The size of the award would be commensurate with
     performance; provided, however, your annual grants will be for no
     less than 150,000 shares.  The ten year option rights would vest at
     the rate of one-fourth per year over four years and be priced at
     the closing price on the day before the grant date.

       b.     Restricted Stock
              ________________

         You will also receive an annual restricted stock grant under
     the aforementioned Plan.  These grants will also be made in July of
     each year, with your first annual grant being in July 2005.  The
     size of the grants would be commensurate with performance, but in
     no event be valued at less than $2,000,000 per year.  These rights
     will also vest at the rate of one-fourth per year over the four
     years following the date of grant.

5.     Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
       _______________________________

     In July 2005, you will receive a target award in Nike's '06-'08
LTIP on terms determined by the Compensation Committee.  Your target
award will be $600,000 delivered in cash or Nike stock.  The actual
award will be 0-150% of the target award depending on Nike achieving
both EPS and revenue goals.  Also in July 2005, you will receive (a) a
$600,000 target award in a special '06-'07 LTIP that will have EPS and
revenue goals consistent with the remaining performance in Nike's
existing '05-'07 LTIP, and (b) a $283,000 target award in a special '06
LTIP that will have EPS and revenue goals consistent with the remaining
performance in Nike's existing '04-'06 LTIP.  Although you will not
participate in the '03-'05 LTIP or any corresponding LTIP, you will be
paid an additional cash bonus in August 2005 equal to the amount you
would have received if you had been a participant in the '03-'05 LTIP
with an $83,000 target award.

6.     Employee Benefit Plans.
       ______________________

     Of course, as a Nike employee, you will be eligible to participate
in the company's 401k and Profit Sharing Plans.  Under the former, Nike
matches 100% of the employee's first 4% of compensation contributed to
the Plan.  The company makes a "make up" contribution each year to the
non-qualified Nike Deferred Compensation Plan equal to the profit
sharing percentage for the year under the Profit Sharing Plan multiplied
by your salary and bonus in excess of the indexed cap ($210,000 in 2005)
on salary and bonus eligible under IRS regulations for profit sharing
under the qualified Profit Sharing Plan.  The company also provides
typical medical and life insurance options, as well as vacation and
other welfare benefits.  You will be credited initially with five weeks'
paid time off (PTO) per year.

7.     Initial Incentives.
       __________________

       a.     Stock Options
              _____________

         Upon commencement of employment, you will be granted the option
     (under the previously described incentive plan) to purchase 200,000
     shares of Nike Class B common stock, with an exercise price equal
     to the closing price on the day before the stock option is granted.
     These ten year options will vest at the rate of one-third per year
     over three years.

       b.     Restricted Stock
              ________________

         Upon commencement of employment, you will also be granted
     100,000 shares of restricted stock, which will likewise vest at the
     rate of one-third per year over three years.

       c.     Relocation Assistance
              _____________________

         Nike's general relocation policy, which covers almost all
     moving costs, will apply to assist you in moving to the Portland,
     Oregon, area and an additional cash payment of $50,000 will be
     provided to cover incidental expenses of such a move.

8.     Employment Status and Early Termination of Employment.
       _____________________________________________________

     As an employee of Nike, your employment will be "at will" and
terminable by either you or Nike at any time.  However, if, within the
first three years of your employment, Nike terminates your employment
without cause (where "cause" would be limited to acts of dishonesty,
insubordination or substantial repeated neglect of material duties) or
you resign for good reason (where "good reason" would be any of a
material breach of this Agreement by Nike, a material change, without
your consent, in the title, functions and reporting relationships of
your position (including removal or failure to re-elect you to the
Board), or if you are required, without your consent, to relocate your
office more than 35 miles from Beaverton, Oregon), you will receive  a
lump sum severance within thirty days of termination equal to two years'
base salary plus your actual PSP bonus for the fiscal year of separation
from Nike based on Nike, Inc. performance or the full year's PSP bonus
at your target rate, whichever is greater.  In addition, you will vest
in the restricted stock and stock options granted at initial employment,
but not in rights subsequently granted.  If Nike terminates your
employment without cause or you resign for good reason at any time after
your first three years of employment, you will receive severance equal
to two years' base salary.  Upon a termination without cause or for good
reason at any time, you will have continued exercisability of the stock
options granted at initial employment for three years (or for the
unexpired term of the options if less).  You will not have a duty to
mitigate or to seek employment elsewhere as a condition to receiving
your severance payments.  Such payments shall in no event be reduced by
any income earned from subsequent employment or self-employment.

     In any event, it is understood that before a decision to terminate
your employment is made, you will be apprised in writing of the issues
or concerns of the Board of Directors that might lead to termination,
and be given an opportunity over a period of not less than thirty days
to attempt to resolve such concerns.  Of course, the ultimate
disposition of the matter will be up to the Board.


9.     Non-Competition and Indemnification.
       ___________________________________

     Given your position, it is Nike's policy, and the Board of
Directors will expect you to sign, a Non-Compete Agreement when you
begin employment with Nike.

     As a director and executive officer of Nike, the company provides
the protection of an Indemnity Agreement, indemnifying you against
claims asserted against you as a result of your status as a director and
executive officer, or as a result of actions taken or not taken in the
performance of your executive responsibilities.  This Agreement details
the indemnification provisions of the company's by-laws and is secured
by the company's credit as well as Directors' and Officers' coverage,
the current program providing $100 million of coverage in excess of the
company's $25 million deductible.  (The deductible does not apply to
Side A coverage which insures directors and officers directly when there
is no corporate indemnification available.)

                                           NIKE, Inc.

                                           By:


                                 NIKE, INC.

                               EXHIBIT A TO
                        1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
                  NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT


      1.     Termination of Employment or Service.

             1.1     General Rule.  Except as provided in this Section
1, the Option may not be exercised unless at the time of exercise the
Optionee is employed by or in the service of the Company and shall have
been so employed or provided such service continuously since the Grant
Date.  For purposes of this Exhibit A, the Optionee is considered to be
employed by or in the service of the Company if the Optionee is employed
by or in the service of the Company or any parent or subsidiary
corporation of the Company (an "Employer").

             1.2     Termination Generally. If the Optionee's employment
or service with the Company terminates for any reason other than because
of the Optionee's total disability, death or retirement as provided in
Sections 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5, the Option may be exercised at any time before
the Expiration Date or the expiration of three months after the date of
termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the
extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of
termination.

            1.3     Termination Because of Total Disability. If the
Optionee's employment or service with the Company terminates because of
total disability, the Option shall immediately become exercisable in
full and may be exercised at any time before the Expiration Date or
before the date that is one year after the date of termination,
whichever is the shorter period.  The term "total disability" means a
medically determinable mental or physical impairment that is expected to
result in death or has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous
period of 12 months or more and that, in the opinion of the Company and
two independent physicians, causes the Optionee to be unable to perform
duties as an employee, director, officer or consultant of the Employer
and unable to be engaged in any substantial gainful activity.  Total
disability shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day after the
two independent physicians have furnished their written opinion of total
disability to the Company and the Company has reached an opinion of
total disability.

            1.4     Termination Because of Death.  If the Optionee dies
while employed by or in the service of the Company, the Option shall
immediately become exercisable in full and may be exercised at any time
before the Expiration Date or before the date that is one year after the
date of death, whichever is the shorter period, but only by the person
or persons to whom the Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by
the Optionee's will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the
state or country of domicile at the time of death.

            1.5     Termination Because of Retirement.  If the
Optionee's employment or service with the Company terminates because of
the Optionee's retirement, the Option may be exercised at any time
before the Expiration Date or before the expiration of three months
after the date of termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only
to the extent specified in this Section 1.5.  For purposes of this
Section 1.5, the term "retirement" means a termination of employment or
service that occurs at a time when (a) the Optionee's retirement point
total is at least 55, and (b) the Optionee has been employed by or in
the service of the Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation of the
Company for at least five full years.  For purposes of this Section 1.5,
the term "retirement point total" means the sum of the Optionee's age in
full years plus the number of full years that the Optionee has been
employed by or in the service of the Company or a parent or subsidiary
corporation of the Company.  Upon the Optionee's retirement, the
Optionee may exercise the portion of the Option that the Optionee was
entitled to exercise immediately prior to retirement plus a percentage
of the remaining unvested portion of the Option based on the Optionee's
retirement point total at the time of retirement as set forth in the
following table:

                                          Percent of Unvested Option
            Retirement Point Total         That Becomes Exercisable
            ______________________        __________________________

                   55 or 56                           20%
                      57                              40%
                      58                              60%
                      59                              80%
                      60                             100%

            1.6     Absence on Leave.  Absence on leave or on account of
illness or disability under rules established by the committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company appointed to administer the Plan (the
"Committee") shall not be deemed an interruption of employment or
service.

            1.7     Failure to Exercise Option.  To the extent that
following termination of employment or service, the Option is not
exercised within the applicable periods described above, all further
rights to purchase shares pursuant to the Option shall cease and
terminate.

     2.     Method of Exercise of Option.  The Option may be exercised
only by notice in writing from the Optionee to the Company of the
Optionee's binding commitment to purchase shares, specifying the number
of shares the Optionee desires to purchase under the Option and the date
on which the Optionee agrees to complete the transaction and, if
required to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, containing a
representation that it is the Optionee's intention to acquire the shares
for investment and not with a view to distribution.  On or before the
date specified for completion of the purchase, the Optionee must pay the
Company the full purchase price of those shares in cash or by check.
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, no shares shall be issued
until full payment for the shares has been made, including all amounts
owed for tax withholding.  The Optionee shall, immediately upon
notification of the amount due, if any, pay to the Company in cash or by
check amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and
local tax withholding requirements.  If additional withholding is or
becomes required (as a result of exercise of the Option or as a result
of disposition of shares acquired pursuant to exercise of the Option)
beyond any amount deposited before delivery of the certificates, the
Optionee shall pay such amount to the Company, in cash or by check, on
demand.  If the Optionee fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company
or the Employer may withhold that amount from other amounts payable to
the Optionee, including salary, subject to applicable law.

     3.     Nontransferability.  The Option is nonassignable and
nontransferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of
law, except as provided below and except by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution of the state or country of the Optionee's
domicile at the time of death, and during the Optionee's lifetime, the
Option is exercisable only by the Optionee.  The Option shall also be
transferable pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act.  Following any permitted transfer, the
Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable immediately prior to the transfer, provided that, except
for purposes of Section 1, the term "Optionee" shall be deemed to refer
to the transferee.  All references in Section 1 to employment or
service, termination of employment or service and total disability,
death and retirement shall continue to be applied with respect to the
original Optionee.  Following any termination of employment or service
or total disability, death or retirement of the original Optionee as
described in Section 1, the Option shall be exercisable by the
transferee only to the extent and for the periods specified.

     4.     Changes in Capital Structure.  If the outstanding shares of
Common Stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
other securities of the Company or of another corporation by reason of
any reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of exchange,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, combination of
shares or dividend payable in shares, appropriate adjustment shall be
made by the Committee in the number and kind of shares subject to the
Option, or the unexercised portion thereof, so that the Optionee's
proportionate interest before and after the occurrence of the event is
maintained; provided, however, that this Section 4 shall not apply with
respect to Approved Transactions (as defined below).  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Committee shall have no obligation to effect any
adjustment that would or might result in the issuance of fractional
shares, and any fractional shares resulting from any adjustment may be
disregarded or provided for in any manner determined by the Committee.
Any such adjustments made by the Committee shall be conclusive.  In the
event of any merger, consolidation or plan of exchange affecting the
Company to which Section 5 does not apply, the Committee may, in its
sole discretion, provide a 30-day period prior to such event during
which the Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option, in whole
or in part, without any limitation on exercisability, and upon the
expiration of such 30-day period, the Option shall immediately
terminate.

     5.     Special Acceleration in Certain Events.  Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, the Option shall, at any time when
the shareholders of the Company approve an Approved Transaction,
immediately become exercisable in full during the remainder of the term
of the Option; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, provide a 30-day period prior to the Approved Transaction
during which the Optionee shall have the right to exercise the Option,
in whole or in part, without any limitation on exercisability, and upon
the expiration of such 30-day period, the Option shall immediately
terminate.  For purposes of this Section 5, the term "Approved
Transaction" means (a) any consolidation, merger, plan of exchange or
transaction involving the Company (a "Merger") in which the Company is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which the
Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or
other property, other than a Merger involving the Company in which the
holders of the Common Stock of the Company immediately prior to the
Merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the
surviving corporation after the Merger or (b) any sale, lease, exchange
or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related
transactions) of all or substantially all of the  assets of the Company
or the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or
dissolution of the Company.

     6.     Conditions on Obligations.  The Company shall not be
obligated to issue shares of Class B Common Stock upon exercise of the
Option if the Company is advised by its legal counsel that such issuance
would violate applicable state or federal laws, including securities
laws.  The Company will use its best efforts to take steps required by
state or federal law or applicable regulations in connection with
issuance of shares upon exercise of the Option.

     7.     No Right to Employment or Service.  Nothing in the Plan or
this Agreement shall (a) confer upon the Optionee any right to be
continued in the employment of an Employer or interfere in any way with
the Employer's right to terminate the Optionee's employment at will at
any time, for any reason, with or without cause, or to decrease the
Optionee's compensation or benefits, or (b) confer upon the Optionee any
right to be retained or employed by the Employer or to the continuation,
extension, renewal or modification of any compensation, contract or
arrangement with or by the Employer.  The determination of whether to
grant any option under the Plan is made by the Company in its sole
discretion. The grant of the Option shall not confer upon the Optionee
any right to receive any additional option or other award under the Plan
or otherwise.

     8.     Successors of Company.  This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of any successor of the Company but,
except as provided herein, the Option may not be assigned or otherwise
transferred by the Optionee.

     9.     Rights as a Shareholder.  The Optionee shall have no rights
as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Class B Common Stock
until the date the Optionee becomes the holder of record of those
shares.  No adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for
which the record date occurs before the date the Optionee becomes the
holder of record.

     10.     Amendments.   The Company may at any time amend this
Agreement to extend the expiration periods provided in Section 1 or to
increase the portion of the Option that is exercisable.  Otherwise, this
Agreement may not be amended without the written consent of the Optionee
and the Company.

     11.     Committee Determinations.  The Optionee agrees to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations of the
Committee or other administrator of the Plan as to the provisions of the
Plan or this Agreement or any questions arising thereunder.

     12.     Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the state of Oregon.

     13.     Complete Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the Optionee and the Company, both oral and written
concerning the matters addressed herein, and all prior agreements or
representations concerning the matters addressed herein, whether written
or oral, express or implied, are terminated and of no further effect.

Exhibit 10.3

                              NIKE, INC.

                   RESTRICTED STOCK BONUS AGREEMENT


     This Agreement is entered into as of _______, 200_, between NIKE,
Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and _____________ (the
"Recipient").

     The Company has awarded a restricted stock bonus to the Recipient
pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Company's 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the
"Plan") and Recipient desires to accept the award subject to the terms
and conditions of this agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1.     Award of Restricted Stock Bonus.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the Recipient
_______ shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company (the "Restricted
Shares").  The Restricted Shares are subject to forfeiture to the
Company as set forth in Section 2 below.

2.     Forfeiture Restriction.  If the Recipient ceases to be employed
by the Company for any reason or for no reason, with or without cause,
other than death or physical disability (within the meaning of Section
22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), any unvested
Restricted Shares shall be forfeited to the Company.  All of the
Restricted Shares shall initially be unvested, and shall vest with
respect to _________ of the total Restricted Shares on each of the
anniversaries of the date of this Agreement or, if earlier, upon the
occurrence of a Special Acceleration (as defined in Section 11 of the
Plan).  If the Recipient ceases to be employed by the Company as a
result of death or physical disability (within the meaning of Section
22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), all of the
Restricted Shares shall immediately vest.  Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall confer upon Recipient any right to be employed by the
Company or to continue to provide services to the Company or to
interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate
Recipient's services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.


3.     Restriction on Transfer.  The Recipient shall not sell, assign,
pledge, or in any manner transfer unvested Restricted Shares, or any
right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, whether voluntarily or
by operation of law, or by gift, bequest or otherwise.  Any sale or
transfer, or purported sale or transfer, of unvested Restricted Shares,
or any right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, in violation of
this Section 3 shall be null and void.

4.     Tax Withholding.  Recipient acknowledges that, at the time any
portion of the Restricted Shares vests, the value of such vested
Restricted Shares will be treated as ordinary compensation income for
federal and state income and FICA tax purposes, and that the Company
will be required to withhold taxes on this income amount.  Promptly
following vesting, the Company will notify Recipient of the required
withholding amount.  Within 10 days of such notice, Recipient shall pay
to the Company the required withholding amount by surrendering to the
Company for cancellation vested Restricted Shares or other shares of
Class B Common Stock valued at the closing market price for the Class B
Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the date of Recipient's
election to surrender such shares.

5.     Rights as Shareholder; Dividends.  Upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the award of the Restricted Shares shall be
completed and, except as limited by this Agreement, the Recipient shall
be the owner of the Restricted Shares with all rights of a shareholder,
including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and to receive
ordinary dividends payable with respect to the Restricted Shares from
the date of this Agreement.  Until the Restricted Shares become vested,
they will not be treated as issued shares for federal income tax
purposes and dividends paid to the Recipient with respect to the
Restricted Shares will be treated for federal income tax purposes as
additional compensation subject to applicable withholding.

6.     Stock Certificate.  To secure the rights of the Company under
Sections 2 and 4, the Company will retain the certificate or
certificates representing the Restricted Shares.  Upon any forfeiture of
the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement, the Company shall have
the right to cancel the Restricted Shares in accordance with this
Agreement without any further action by the Recipient.  Upon any failure
of the Recipient to pay required withholding under Section 4, the
Company shall have the right to cancel vested Restricted Shares with a
value equal to the required withholding amount without any further
action by the Recipient.  After Restricted Shares have vested and all
required withholding has been paid to the Company in connection with
such vesting, the Company shall deliver a certificate for the vested
Restricted Shares to the Recipient.

7.     Additional Company Shares.  If, prior to vesting of Restricted
Shares, the outstanding Class B Common Stock is increased as a result of
a stock dividend or stock split, the restrictions and other provisions
of this Agreement shall apply to any such additional shares of Class B
Common Stock which are issued in respect of the Restricted Shares to the
same extent as such restrictions and other provisions apply to the
Restricted Shares.

8.     Restrictive Legends.  Stock certificates for shares issued under
this Agreement may bear the following legends:

            The shares represented by this certificate are subject to a
        Restricted Stock Bonus Agreement between the registered owner
        and NIKE, Inc. which restricts the transferability of the
        shares.  A copy of the agreement is on file with the Secretary
        of NIKE, Inc.

9.     Miscellaneous.

     9.1      Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subjects hereof
and may be amended only by written agreement between the Company and the
Recipient.

     9.2      Notices.  Any notice required or permitted under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when
delivered personally to the party to whom it is addressed or when
deposited into the United States Mail as registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the Company,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, at its principal executive offices or to
the Recipient at the address of Recipient in the Company's records, or
at such other address as such party may designate by ten (10) days'
advance written notice to the other party.

     9.3      Rights and Benefits.  The rights and benefits of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Company's successors and assigns and, subject to the restrictions on
transfer of this Agreement, be binding upon the Recipient's heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

     9.4      Further Action.  The parties agree to execute such further
instruments and to take such further action as may reasonably be
necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

     9.5      Applicable Law; Attorney Fees.  The terms and conditions
of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon.
In the event either party institutes litigation hereunder, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees to be set
by the trial court and, upon any appeal, the appellate court.

     9.6      Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this
Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
