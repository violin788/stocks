Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Nike's fiscal 2009 first quarter conference
call. For those who need to reference today's press release, you'll find it at
www.nikebiz.com. Leading today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice President,
Investor Relations.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Before I
turn the call over to Miss Catlett, let me remind you that participants of this
call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and
those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed
in the reports filed with the SEC including Forms 8-K, 10-K, and
10-Q.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Some
forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily
indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of
futures and at once orders, change rate fluctuations, order cancellations and
discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it
is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE Incorporated's business
including equipment, most of Nike Retail, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Converse,
Hurley, and Umbro are not included in these future numbers.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Finally,
participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of
comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations are found at Nike's
website. This call might also include discussion of non-public financial and
statistical information which is also publicly available at that site,
www.nikebiz.com. Now I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Catlett, Vice
President, Investor Relations.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Pamela
Catlett: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today
to discuss Nike's fiscal 2009 first quarter results. As the operator indicated,
participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A
comparative presentation of reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP reported
items can be found in our press release which as you know was issued about an
hour ago and can be found on our website nikebiz.com.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Joining
us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Charlie
Denson, President of the Nike Brand; and finally you will hear from our Chief
Financial Officer, Don Blair who will give you an in-depth review of our
financial results. Following their prepared remarks, as usual we will take your
questions and as many of you know, we would like to allow as many of you to ask
questions as possible in the allotted time.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Consequently
we would appreciate you focusing your initial questions to two and in the event
you have additional questions, please do re-queue if others do not cover them.
With that, thank you very much for your cooperation and it is now my pleasure to
introduce NIKE, Inc. CEO, Mark Parker.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Mark
Parker: Thanks Pam, and welcome everybody to the first quarter earnings call for
fiscal year 2009. Q1 again demonstrated the strength of our brands and our
business. We continue to gain share in key markets and deliver growth in revenue
and profitability. That said, we're not stopping to celebrate and we're not
complacent and we're clear on what is needed to deliver our goals through fiscal
year '09 and beyond.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Let's go
to the numbers first. NIKE, Inc. revenue was up 17% to $5.4 billion. That's 28
consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Gross
margins are up 240 basis points. Reported global futures are up 10% which marks
31 consecutive quarters of futures increases. And diluted EPS was down 8% from
Q1 '08, influenced by onetime tax benefits that contributed to $20.20 per
diluted share last year.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As I have
said in the past, Nike will continue to invest in growth opportunities that
offer the greatest potential for return. These Q1 results are in line with our
ability to leverage those investments, our brands and our resources across the
portfolio.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We can't
talk about results or opportunity without considering the broader environment.
While there is financial uncertainty in some sectors, our results continue to
warrant confidence in the power and flexibility of our businesses.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We
recognize the impact of prices, inflation and currency fluctuations and we
realize that no one is immune; all of which reinforces my commitment to our
simple and consistent strategy -- manage for continued growth by leveraging the
competitive advantages that we control; namely innovation, focus, and consumer
relevance. Innovative product is at the core of Nike and practically speaking,
it is where consumers cast their vote on your brand.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We landed
in Beijing with new footwear and apparel for all 28 Olympic sports. We launched
Flywire technology in the Hyperdunk and Zoom Victory spike. We launched
Lunarlite cushioning in the Lunar Racer. We launched new Swift apparel and we're
seeing consumers all over the world embrace these innovations and
others.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">By any
objective analysis, we lead in product innovation in our industry and we will
keep that front and center going forward always. Seeing that innovation become
reality, a profitable reality requires focus today more than ever; focus on
maximizing the potential for growth, focus on leveraging our SG&amp;A and other
resources and focus on creating value for shareholders.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're
just coming off a summer that created tremendous global excitement in sports and
we're moving into the season of championships and team sports. That puts Nike in
a great position to move through the year capitalizing on that
energy.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're
also focused on leveraging our resources across the portfolio. Our supply chain
is one of Nike's greatest competitive advantages. Lean manufacturing, material
sourcing, digital efficiencies, it all helps us get the right products to the
right places at the right time at the right price and that is good for our
consumers, our retailers, and certainly our gross margins.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Of course
we focus on deploying capital thoughtfully and returning cash to shareholders.
Over the last 10 years, we have repurchased $5.5 billion of stock. As we
complete our current $3 billion program, we will begin a new $5 billion
repurchase program over the next four years.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I can
assure you that this management team is focused on leveraging the entire Nike
portfolio to meet our goal of $23 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year
2011. We are relevant with consumers because we understand each other. They know
we create innovative products and experiences, they value that performance and
authenticity and that's why we continue to gain market share.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That's
why we've reclaimed our rightful spot atop the running category. When I look at
China and the Beijing Olympics, I see a great example of how Nike leverages our
innovation, focus and consumer relevance. I've spent a lot of time in China
before and during the Olympics.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I have
never been more impressed with our ability to execute on all levels. Our
products were the most compelling and advanced. Our stories and messages were
inspiring and our Nike stores did more than just set sales records. They were
destinations for hundreds of thousands of Chinese consumers.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">By every
measure, the Olympic Games achieved its promise for China, for sport and for
Nike. We were the clear winner in Beijing and the choice of Chinese consumers.
More importantly now that the torch has been extinguished, the deep consumer
connections and experiences we built set the stage for a strong sustained
long-term growth in China.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And
what's happening in China right now is happening in every emerging market for
Nike around the world including Brazil, India, Turkey and Russia. People are
embracing Nike as the authentic leader in sports.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But it's
not all about the Nike Brand at the Olympics. Our affiliate businesses also
delivered a strong first quarter as they continue to grow and become a larger

gaining some serious top and bottom-line momentum. Revenue was up 38%, the
biggest quarter ever for Hurley. The brand really showed its strength at the
recent Action Sports Retailer Show in San Diego. Action sports as you know, is
one of the fastest-growing segments in our industry and with our NIKE, Inc.
portfolio, specifically Hurley, Converse and the Nike Brand; we're
well-positioned to go after that growth.</font></div>

our ongoing affiliate business has posted overall revenue growth of 20% and

growing futures, growing brands, I think this shows the power of leadership and
a sound strategy in our industry.</font></div>

connect with consumers through our category offense, a strategy Nike got out in
front of early and is now accelerating. It is the key to the innovation, focus
and relevance I mentioned earlier and it's driving the work we're doing with our
retail partners, segmenting and differentiating our brand and their stores in
the marketplace.</font></div>

the future of our industry is based on a more intimate relationship with this

ability to leverage our assets and core competencies across our portfolio of

whether it's a new technology, a new category or a new brand. I see tremendous
potential throughout our industry and as the leader, we're clear and confident
in how to turn that potential into real growth and value for our shareholders.
And we will continue to do so. So now here's Charlie with some more news on the

Denson: Thanks Mark. Good afternoon everyone. Well, the Nike Brand is off to a
solid start for fiscal year '09. It's been an amazing summer, our little summer
of sport and we have been busy.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We
started with the NBA finals where Paul Pierce led the Boston Celtics to their
first title in 22 years. We watched Tiger's amazing Monday playoff win at the
U.S. Open and then Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres led Spain to their first
Euro title in 44 years.</font></div>

Nadal and Roger Federer put on the greatest show ever at Wimbledon. It put
tennis back on the front page and it took Rafa to the number one ranking in the
world only to be followed by Roger's U.S. Open title, his 13th Grand Slam
victory and just one short of tying Pete Samaras&#8217; record. And of course, the
biggest show on earth, the Beijing Olympics.</font></div>

heck of a summer for ourselves as well. On the quarter, the Nike Brand generated
record revenue of $4.8 billion up 18%. Every region increased revenue. Global
footwear was up 19% and global apparel was up 18% and all six of our key
categories saw revenue increases year-over-year. So a really solid performance
by the Nike Brand in the first quarter.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

confident in our ability to build on the success of Q1 and I will give you three
reasons why. First, our category offense. As Mark said, it's at the center of
our growth strategy for the brand and we're just beginning to see the depth of
its true potential. Let's take running for an example.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">18 months
ago, Nike held a number of two or three spots around the world with the core
competitive runner; respectable for most, but unacceptable for Nike. By diving
deep and focusing exclusively on the performance-minded runner, we generated
strong revenue increases across all product platforms in all
regions.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Revenue
from the running experience in NikeTown in New York is up 45%. And we held a
little 10-K run we called The Human Race. Over 800,000 people showed up. It was
the biggest running event in history and something only Nike could
do.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

created some real energy in running and we did it by connecting completely with
the athlete. It was all enabled by Nike+ which starts to give you a sense of the
importance of social networking as part of our brand experience. That's the
category offense at work. We are applying that same intensity to all six of our
key categories.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Okay,
confidence builder number two. It's retail. We're getting a really clear view of
how to change the game in retail and we're starting to see results in stores
now.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our
retail revenues are up 18% around the world and in the U.S. we saw a 6% increase
in comp store sales for in-line stores. I just mentioned the running experience
in New York but you'd also have to add the Bootroom in NikeTown London where
revenues are up 40%.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

the digital side, e-commerce and customization continue to grow. There's more on
retail, but I'm going to come back to that in a minute.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

let me tell you a little bit about Beijing. This was by far our most successful
single event ever on multiple fronts. The presence and messaging of the Nike
Brand was the best I've ever seen.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Chinese
consumers really connected with what Nike is all about -- innovation,
authenticity, individuality, a passion for sports. They did really get it. And
we set sales records in stores all over China.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In fact,
I was in our store on Wan Fu Jing Road road in Beijing. It was so crowded I
couldn't even see the floor. These Olympic Games were the most watched Olympics
in history and so our investment in Beijing is paying off, not just in China but
it is impacting our business all over the world.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">One last
thing on Beijing. I mentioned about eight months ago that this Olympics had the
potential to re-ignite basketball around the world. I think that's exactly what
happened.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We saw
the best basketball tournament ever played. It was a global tournament and it
had global stars; great for the game and great for Nike. It was a microcosm of
what is going on with basketball worldwide. And by the way, eight out of every
10 players on every team, men's and women's, were wearing Nike shoes. I can
confidently say that we now have two global team sports, soccer and basketball,
and we lead in both.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Okay,
real quick let's look at the regions. Starting with the U.S., the region
performed extremely well on a very tough retail environment. Futures are up and
our total revenue is up 8%. Our retail revenues increased 16%.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We saw
very strong performances in running, action sports and basketball. Apparel
revenue increased 9% with strong advances in training apparel and double-digit
growth in both running and basketball apparel. Sportswear apparel remains a work
in progress.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

there's a lot of visible growth opportunity in the U.S. Consumers are a bit
cautious but they are passionate about those products and brands that deliver
exceptional performance. We continue to be the brand of choice.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Over in
Europe and EMEA, we're off to a strong start with football and running the
leading the way into the future. On a constant dollar basis, revenue was up 5%
as we continue to grow in the key countries.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

Germany and the Alpine countries, revenues were up 11% which speaks well to our
strategy at the European championships. Turkey and Russia are up over 30% and in
the UK, our revenues climbed 5%.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

seeing some tough economic conditions in Spain, Italy and France where we're
staying focused on connecting with consumers and managing our distribution and
our inventories. In the Americas region, first quarter revenues grew by 19% and
futures are up 24%. Football, running, women's training and sportswear all had
strong double-digit growth.</font></div>

finally back to Asia, revenue was up 26% including growth in every major country
in the region. Japan continues to trend up with revenue growth of 2% and futures
are up at 4%. And in China, revenue increased over 50%. I have already talked
about the Olympics but just in case I haven't convinced anyone yet of our
success and staying power in China, I'll just say one more thing. Our futures
orders there are up nearly 50%.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

let's go back to retail. Our strategy here is based on one thing -- that Nike
Retail is a mirror of the Nike Brand. But it's not about doors. It's about
experiences.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

Brand always leads with innovative product and that pipeline has the best
product we have ever seen. Flywire technology alone is going to reset the
standard of performance in multiple categories. That is a compelling
story.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The Nike
Brand is all about this category focus. Any retail execution we do will be
driven through the lens of core consumers in our six key categories. And the
Nike Brand creates a sense of community.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">You heard
Mark talk about that consumer, how relevant it is to the consumer. Community is
a big part of it. Put those together and you get the running experience of
NikeTown New York or you get the Bootroom in London. You get a category focus
that drives the entire consumer experience all the way through
retail.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">These are
the advantages we bring to our retail destinations and to our wholesale

invest in the people, the processes and the structures necessary to create
distinction and separation for the Nike Brand.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

ever before.</font></div>

Blair: Thanks Charlie. Well as you have heard from my colleagues, we think Q1
was a great start to fiscal 2009. All of our brands posted higher revenues for
the quarter and our gross margin grew 240 basis points.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

first quarter earnings per share declined as a result of planned SG&amp;A

where we expected to be at this point in the year. On balance, we're very happy
with the strength of our brands and the performance of our

past several years, you've often heard me talk about our commitment to investing
for the future while also delivering growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow.
In the dynamic global environment in which we compete, our focus on managing all
of the levers of the NIKE, Inc. P&amp;L and balance sheet has allowed us to
achieve that goal and is a strength we believe distinguishes our

paraphrase Mark, today's results reflect our ability to leverage our
investments. We have invested in our brands to drive topline growth and we
posted double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We have
invested in emerging markets. In this quarter China grew over 50%, Russia grew
over 40% and Brazil grew 30%.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

invested in our multi-brand portfolio and revenues from our continuing Other
businesses are up almost 20%. We've invested in our supply chain to optimize our
efficiency and our gross margins grew strongly despite Asian cost pressures and
we have invested in Nike Brand retail which grew 14% in constant dollars
highlighted by a 6% increase in comp store sales for in-line
stores.</font></div>

revenue's up, futures are up, gross margins are strong and consumers continue to
seek the Nike Brand experience around the world. In today's environment,
managing our business to invest for the future and deliver growth today means we
remain relentlessly focused on healthy topline growth, keeping our inventories
tight and driving a more rigorous focus on cost management throughout the
organization. We think we have made the right investments and we will continue
to leverage them to fuel our growth.</font></div>

on our last call and driven by accelerated growth in orders for U.S. footwear.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined 8% to $1.03 reflecting

margin for the quarter grew 240 basis points to 47.2%, somewhat higher than we'd
expected. We anticipated many of the factors that drove the year-on-year
improvement -- better exchange rates, effective sourcing cost initiatives,
retail expansion, selected footwear price increases, and a shift in mix to
higher margin styles. The upside came primarily as a result of higher margins in
our Other businesses and less rapid cost inflation in Asia than we
expected.</font></div>

interest income for the first quarter was $10 million, $14 million below last

strength of our balance sheet also continues to be a true point of difference
for Nike particularly in the current financial climate. For the quarter, we
generated $249 million of free cash flow from operations, up 10% year-on-year. A
key driver was working capital which reflected a six day improvement in the cash

anticipate interest income to continue to track below prior year levels,

help us to get comfortable with the currency going forward in terms of the
strengthening dollar and how things are hedged out for the rest of the year? And
the other half a question would be on the oil prices. With oil prices

the major currencies.</font></div>

fiscal '09, you know we do expect that in the long run we're probably going to
see some dollar strengthening. And so in the last six to nine months, we have
been doing some extended hedging out into fiscal '10 and '11.</font></div>

this point we have some protection for '10 and '11. We have a great deal of
protection against fiscal '09. So we're largely hedged for '09 and we're putting
hedges out into '10 and '11. And the way that we think about this is hedges are
really intended to give us time to adjust our business model.</font></div>

we're also doing is with the expectation that we're going to see some dollar

then the related to that, your inventory levels, if you could sort of comment on

a pretty well-oiled machine now and as we've talked many times about the success
that we've had in the core cities and we're now starting to branch out into the

where we can't really start to build some of our capabilities and capacities. It
is in a much earlier stage of growth than China is overall.</font></div>

the Olympics? We feel very good about them. We are in good shape. We're building

a huge success for us on the ground in all the stores whether it was in Beijing

that as well.</font></div>

China?</font></div>

Denson: We talked about this quite a bit going into the games and actually over
the last couple of years. Our destination was not the Olympic Games. In fact, we
actually tried to position that as more of a launching pad than a destination. I

for the long haul and we have committed to that.</font></div>

completely well-thought-out and positioned branding campaign that continues now
well beyond the Olympics, continuing to stay connected with the consumer. And
one of the things that we're seeing coming out of the Olympics which we did
anticipate was just a completely accelerated interest around sport that fuels
both participation as well as association. And I think those things are starting
to play themselves out. I mean it's early days but we feel very confident that
the Chinese consumer and the Chinese athlete has a more robust appetite than
ever.</font></div>

phenomenal.</font></div>

think it's really setting the stage for Nike retail in other parts of the world.
And I couldn't agree more with Charlie that the appetite for sports in China is
tremendous and really feel like the Olympics went a long way to kind of
reinforcing our brand strength in that market. So a great accelerator for us and
we are very bullish on Nike in China post the Olympics.</font></div>

Shanley: At any rate, Charlie, you mentioned in discussing Europe that some of
the countries in the CEMEA region did extremely well and some of the countries
in Western Europe surprisingly enough, the UK did well in addition. I wonder if
you could break out for us -- just give us an overall regional comparison in
terms of how the first quarter developed for the CEMEA region versus the rest of
Western Europe in aggregate.</font></div>

Denson: Central Europe continues to be very strong growth. And I think Don went
through some of the numbers up front as well. I think where we have seen the
softness is really along the Mediterranean, Iberia, Southern France, Italy, with
probably the biggest challenge right now in Spain and Portugal where we have
seen some significant softness.</font></div>

one of the things and obviously as we watch this, one of the things that I would
just say that we've kind of done some due diligence here in the sense that the
brand is in very good shape, that we're looking at some overall economic
conditions that are slowing down maybe a little but faster than in some of the
other parts of Europe. So we aren't as concerned around the brand as we are just
keeping an eye on the business, the mechanics, the inventories and all the
things that we do in a slower economic state.</font></div>

Denson: Well, when you look at the overall capacity, I mean certainly from a
population standpoint I think the buying power still has a way to go. We have
got some countries lining up to get into the EU but then there's some issues
there too as well. But the other thing I guess I would say that makes me feel
pretty confident and comfortable is the appetite for sport from a consumer
standpoint is every bit as big in Western Europe -- I mean in Eastern Europe as
it is in Western Europe.</font></div>

Shanley: Fair enough. My other question is to you, Don. You mentioned in your
prepared remarks that U.S. footwear futures were one of the key drivers for the
9% increase in overall future numbers and the U.S. futures in total were up 3%.
Can we assume from that that the footwear segment of the U.S. future markets
were up substantially more than 3%?</font></div>

Blair: Yes, you can infer that. The number that you quoted, the 9%, that is
actually U.S. footwear growth in the first quarter. That's revenue growth in the

significantly more than 3%.</font></div>

Denson: Well certainly the opportunity is out there. We feel great about the --

done a lot to help them on the operational and global sourcing capability side

go in and work with the talent that's already there at Umbro to try to shore up
the areas that are going to help Umbro realize their potential here going
