          NIKE, Inc. Announces Unfavorable Arbitration Ruling
      of Approximately $52.5 Million Involving Converse Subsidiary

BEAVERTON, Ore. (May 16, 2006) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today announced
an arbitration ruling arising from a contract dispute between the
Company's Converse subsidiary and Alon International, S.A., a former
licensee for Converse in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The
arbitrator awarded Alon $52.5 million in damages, plus legal fees, less
some amounts previously paid to Alon. This potential liability had not
been accrued by Nike, and will likely result in a charge to earnings
for the Company's fiscal 2006 fourth quarter ending May 31, 2006.

"We disagree with the ruling and will exercise our legal right to
challenge both the award and the amount of damages," said Nike, Inc.
General Counsel Jim Carter.

Standard confidentiality provisions in the arbitration rules forbid the
Company from commenting on the substance of the ruling.

The actual amount of the fourth quarter charge will be decided by the
arbitrator's final determination of attorney's fees, as well as Nike's
assessment of the likely outcome of any further proceedings. Nike
expects to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 year-end earnings
near the end of June 2006; the Company has not yet announced the exact
date.
