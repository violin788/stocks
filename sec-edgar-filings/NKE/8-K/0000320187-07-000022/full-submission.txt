                          Third Restated Bylaws


                           ARTICLE 1 - Offices

     Section 1.  Principal Office.  The registered office and principal
                 ________________
executive offices of NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Corporation"),
shall be located in Beaverton, Oregon, or such other location as the Board of
Directors may determine.

     Section 2.  Additional Offices.  The Corporation may also have offices at
                 __________________
such other places, either within or without Oregon, as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine or as the business of the Corporation may
require.


                         ARTICLE 2 - Shareholders

     Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of the shareholders of the
                 _________________
Corporation shall be held at Beaverton, Oregon, or any other place, either
within or without Oregon, selected by the Board of Directors, or in the
absence of a selection by the Board of Directors, by the Chairman of the
Board.

     Section 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the shareholders
                 _______________
shall be held on the third Monday in September of each year if not a legal
holiday, and if a legal holiday then on the next succeeding business day, at
such time as may be designated by the Board of Directors and specified in the
notice of the meeting.  The Board of Directors shall have the discretion to
designate a different annual meeting date for any year, provided that the date
so designated is within 60 days of the date specified in the preceding
sentence.  At the annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect by vote a Board
of Directors, consider reports of the affairs of the Corporation, and transact
such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

     Section 3.  Special Meetings.  The Corporation shall hold a special
                 ________________
meeting of shareholders upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, the
President or the Board of Directors, or if the holders of at least 10 percent
of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the
special meeting sign, date and deliver to the Secretary of the Corporation one
or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose or purposes for
which it is to be held.  Special meetings of the shareholders may not be
called by any other person or persons.


     Section 4.  Notice of Meetings and Waiver.
                 _____________________________

     (a)     General.  The Corporation shall notify shareholders in writing of
             _______
the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders meeting not
earlier than 60 days nor less than ten days before the meeting date.  Except


<PAGE>


as otherwise required by applicable law, the Corporation is required to give
notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.  Such notice is
effective when mailed if it is mailed postage prepaid and is correctly

                                   1
addressed to the shareholder's address shown in the Corporation's current
record of shareholders.  Except as otherwise required by applicable law,
notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called.  Notice of a special meeting shall
include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called.

     (b)     Adjourned Meetings.  If an annual or special shareholders meeting
             __________________
is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of
the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the
meeting before adjournment.  If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is
fixed, or is required by law to be fixed, notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.  A
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
shareholders meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless
the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the
meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the
original meeting.

     (c)     Waiver of Notice.  A shareholder's attendance at a meeting waives
             ________________
objection to (i) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the
shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting, and (ii) consideration of a particular
matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in
the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter
when it is presented.

     Section 5.  Quorum.  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group
                 ______
may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares
exists with respect to that matter.  Unless otherwise required by law, a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group
constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.  Once a
share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for
quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of
that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned
meeting.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of those present in person or
represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum
exists.  Any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting
may be transacted at the adjourned meeting if a quorum exists.

     Section 6.  Voting Rights.  The voting rights of holders of stock of the
                 _____________
Corporation, and the circumstances under which any class of stock has special
voting rights and the manner of exercise thereof, are as set forth in the
Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Restated Articles").
Only shares of stock are entitled to vote.  Except as otherwise provided in
the Restated Articles or by applicable law:  (i) each outstanding share,
regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a
shareholders meeting; (ii) if a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than
the election of directors, by a voting group shall be approved if the votes
cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within
the voting group opposing the action; and (iii) directors shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes cast by holders of the shares entitled to vote in the
election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

     Section 7.  Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.  If the name signed on a
                 ___________________________________
vote, consent, waiver or proxy corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the
Corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the vote, consent,

                                   2
waiver or proxy and give it effect as the act of the shareholder.  If the name
signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy does not correspond to the name of
its shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless
entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy and give it effect as
the act of the shareholder if authorized by ORS 60.237 or any successor
provision dealing with acceptance of votes.

     Shares of the Corporation are not entitled to be voted if (i) they are
owned, directly or indirectly, by another domestic or foreign corporation, and
(ii) the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares
entitled to be voted for the directors of such other corporation.  This
paragraph does not limit the power of a corporation to vote any shares,
including its own shares, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

     Any redeemable shares that the Corporation may issue are not entitled to
be voted after notice of redemption is mailed to the holders and a sum
sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company
or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the
holders the redemption price on surrender of the shares.

     Section 8.  Proxies.  A shareholder entitled to vote or to execute any
                 _______
waiver or consent may do so either in person or by written proxy duly executed
and filed at or before the meeting at which it is to be used with the
Secretary at the Corporation or other officer or agent of the Corporation
authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment of a proxy is effective when

     Section 4.  Vacancies.  A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall exist
                 _________
upon the death, resignation or removal of any director or upon an increase in

result of death, resignation or removal from office of a director who is
elected by a separate class vote of the common stock, it shall be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors similarly
elected by such class.  If none shall be remaining, the vacancy shall be
filled by all directors then in office.  If the directors remaining in office
constitute fewer than a quorum of the Board, they may fill the vacancy by an

meeting, each of the directors not present shall sign a written waiver of
notice, or consent to holding such meeting, or an approval of the minutes
thereof.  All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the
corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.  A director's
attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the
director of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting,

unless a different vote is required by law.

     (b)     A director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors,
or is present at a meeting of a committee of the Board of Directors, when

upon the director's arrival, to holding the meeting or transacting business at
the meeting, (ii) the director's dissent or abstention from the action taken
is entered in the minutes of the meeting, or (iii) the director delivers
written notice of dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the
meeting before its adjournment or to the Corporation immediately after
adjournment of the meeting.  The right of dissent or abstention is not
available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.

compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of Directors,
including, without limitation, an annual fee, a fixed sum for attending each
Board and committee meeting, and their expenses of attendance at each meeting
of the Board or a committee.  No such payment shall preclude any director from
serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee,
consultant or otherwise and receiving compensation for that service.

     Section 1.  Validity of Transaction.
                 _______________________
<PAGE>


     (a)     No transaction involving the Corporation shall be voidable by the
Corporation solely because of a director's direct or indirect interest in the
transaction if:

            (i)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's
interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of
the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors or committee authorized,
approved or ratified the transaction;

           (ii)  The material facts of the transaction and the director's
interest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to vote and the
shareholders authorized, approved or ratified the transaction by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Corporation, or by written consent; or

(iii) The transaction was fair and reasonable to the Corporation.

     (b)     This Article 8 shall not invalidate any contract, transaction or
determination that would otherwise be valid under applicable law.

     Section 2.  Indirect Interest.  Solely for purposes of this Article 8, a
                 _________________
director of the Corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if
another entity in which the director has a material financial interest or in
which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or the
transaction with another entity of which the director is a director, officer
or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be
considered by the Board of Directors.

     Section 3.  Authorization by Board.  For purposes of Section 1 of this
                 ______________________
Article 8, a transaction in which a director has an interest is authorized,
approved or ratified by the Board of Directors if it receives the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors, or on the
committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction.  A
transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this Article 8
by a single director.  If a majority of the directors who have no direct or
indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the
transaction, a quorum shall be present for the purpose of taking action under

                                  12

action taken under Section 1 of this Article 8 by the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or
ratified as provided in Section 1 of this Article 8.

     Section 4.  Authorization by Shareholders.  For purposes of Section 1 of

Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or
indirect interest in the transaction, and shares owned by or voted under the
control of any entity described in paragraph (a) of Section 2 of this Article
8 may be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize,
approve or ratify a transaction by vote of the shareholders under Section 1 of

                          ARTICLE 9 - Indemnification

     (a)     The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any person who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to or
witness in, or is otherwise involved in, any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative, or otherwise (including any action, suit or proceeding by or in
the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that:

           (i)  the person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries;

          (ii)  the person is or was serving as a fiduciary within the meaning
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to any
employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or

         (iii)  the person is or was serving, at the request of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as a director or officer, or as a
fiduciary of an employee benefit plan, of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

     (b)     The Corporation may indemnify its employees and other agents to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

     (c)     The expenses incurred by a director or officer or other
indemnified person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative, or otherwise, which the director or officer is made or
threatened to be  made a party to or witness in, or is otherwise involved in,
shall be paid by the Corporation in advance upon written request if the
indemnified person:

           (i)  furnishes the Corporation a written affirmation that in good
faith the person believes that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation; and

          (ii)  furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking to repay such
advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.  Such advances
shall be made without regard to the person's ability to repay such expenses


                                  13
and without regard to the person's ultimate entitlement to indemnification
under this Article or otherwise.

     (d)     The rights of indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be
in addition to any rights to which a person may otherwise be entitled under
any articles of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, statute, policy of insurance,
vote of shareholders or Board of Directors, or otherwise; shall continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation; and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such person.

<PAGE>


     (e)    Any repeal of this Article 9 shall be prospective only and no
repeal or modification of this Article 9 shall adversely affect any right or
protection that is based upon this Article 9 and pertains to an act or
omission that occurred prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

     (f)     As a condition precedent to indemnification under this Article 9,
not later than 30 days after receipt by the director or officer of notice of
the commencement of any proceeding the director or officer shall, if a claim
in respect of the proceeding is to be made against the Corporation under this
Article 9, notify the Corporation in writing of the commencement of the
proceeding.  The failure to properly notify the Corporation shall not relieve
the Corporation from any liability which it may have to the director or
officer otherwise than under this Article 9.  With respect to any proceeding
as to which the director or officer so notifies the Corporation of the
commencement:

            (i)     The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the
proceeding at its own expense.

           (ii)     Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), the
Corporation may, at its option and jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified and electing to assume such defense, assume the defense of
the proceeding, with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the director or
officer.  The director or officer shall have the right to use separate legal
counsel in the proceeding, but the corporation shall not be liable to the
director or officer  under this Article 9 for the fees and expenses of
separate legal counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its
assumption of the defense, unless (A) the director or officer reasonably
concludes that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation and
the director or officer in the conduct of the defense of the proceeding, or
(B) the Corporation does not use legal counsel to assume the defense of such
proceeding.  The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of
any proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Corporation or as to which the
director or officer has made the conclusion provided for in (A) above.

          (iii)  If two or more persons who may be entitled to indemnification
from the Corporation, including the director or officer seeking
indemnification, are parties to any proceeding, the Corporation may require
the director or officer to use the same legal counsel as the other parties.
The director or officer shall have the right to use separate legal counsel in
the proceeding, but the Corporation shall not be liable to the director or
officer under this Article 9 for the fees and expenses of separate legal
counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of the requirement to use
the same legal counsel as the other parties, unless the director or officer
reasonably concludes that there may be a conflict of interest between the
director or officer and any of the other parties required by the Corporation
to be represented by the same legal counsel.

           (iv)     The Corporation shall not be liable to indemnify the
director or officer under this Article 9 for any amounts paid in settlement of
any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be

                                  14
unreasonably withheld.  The director or officer shall permit the Corporation
to settle any proceeding that the Corporation assumes the defense of, except
that the Corporation shall not settle any action or claim in any manner that
would impose any penalty or limitation on the director or officer without such
person's written consent.

<PAGE>


     (g)     Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 9, the Corporation
shall not be obligated under this Article 9 to make any indemnification or
advance any expenses in connection with any claim made against any director or
officer:

           (i)  for which payment is required to be made to or on behalf of
the director or officer under any insurance policy, except with respect to any
excess amount to which the director or officer is entitled under this Article
9 beyond the amount of payment under such insurance policy;

          (ii) if a court having jurisdiction in the matter finally
determines that such indemnification is not lawful under any applicable
statute or public policy;

         (iii) in connection with any proceeding (or part of any proceeding)
initiated by the director or officer, or any proceeding by the director or
officer against the Corporation or its directors, officers, employees or other
persons entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation, unless: (A) the
Corporation is expressly required by law to make the indemnification; (B) the
proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors; or (C) the director or
officer initiated the proceeding pursuant to subsection (i) of this Article 9
and the director or officer is successful in whole or in part in such
proceeding; or

          (iv) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale by
the director or officer of securities of the Corporation within the meaning of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or similar provision of any state statutory
law or common law.

     (h)     In the event of payment under this Article 9, the Corporation
shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of the director or officer.  The director or officer shall execute
all documents required and shall do all acts that may be necessary to secure
such rights and to enable the Corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce
such rights.

     (i)     Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all
rights to indemnification and advances to directors and officers under this
Article 9 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the
same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation and
the director or officer.  Any director or officer may enforce any right to
indemnification or advances under this Article 9 in any court of competent
jurisdiction if: (i) the Corporation denies the claim for indemnification or
advances, in whole or in part, or (ii) the Corporation does not dispose of
such claim within 45 days of request therefor.  It shall be a defense to any
such enforcement action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
advancement of expenses pursuant to, and in compliance with, this Article 9)
that the director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9.  However, except as provided in subsection (f) of this Article 9,
the Corporation shall not assert any defense to an action brought to enforce a
claim for advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article 9 if the director
or officer has tendered to the Corporation the affirmation and undertaking
required hereunder.  The burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that indemnification is not appropriate shall be on the Corporation.  Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the

<PAGE>



commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the
circumstances because the director or officer has met the applicable standard
of conduct nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors or independent legal counsel) that indemnification is improper
because the director or officer has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be asserted as a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the director or officer is not entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9 or otherwise.  The director's or officer's expenses incurred in
connection with successfully establishing such person's right to
indemnification or advances, in whole or in part, in any proceeding shall also
be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation.

     (j)     The rights conferred on any person by this Article 9 shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

     (k)     To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation, upon
approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any
person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article 9.

     (l)     If this Article 9 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on
any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full extent not
prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article 9 that shall not have
been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.


                 ARTICLE 10 - Limitation of Director Liability

     To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Corporation
shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary
damages for conduct as a director.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if the Oregon Revised Statutes are amended, after this Article 10
becomes effective, to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors of the Corporation, then the
liability of directors of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the Oregon Revised Statutes, as so amended.
No amendment or repeal of this Article 10, nor the adoption of any provision
of these Bylaws inconsistent with this Article 10, nor a change in the law,
shall adversely affect any right or protection that is based upon this Article
10 and pertains to conduct that occurred prior to the time of such amendment,
repeal, adoption or change.  No change in the law shall reduce or eliminate
the rights and protections set forth in this Article 10 unless the change in
the law specifically requires such reduction or elimination.

                                 NIKE, INC.

                 FY _______ LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD AGREEMENT

     This FY _______ Long-Term Incentive Award Agreement (this
"Agreement") is entered into as of _____________, 20__, between NIKE,
Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and ________ ("Recipient").


     On _________, 20__, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee")
of the  Company's Board of Directors authorized a performance-based
award to Recipient pursuant to Section 6 of the Company's Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  Compensation paid pursuant to the award
is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Recipient desires to accept the award subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

     1.     Award.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
            _____
Agreement, the Company shall pay to Recipient the dollar amount (the
"Dollar Target Award Payment") determined under this Agreement based on
(a) the Company's financial performance during the _______-year period
from June 1, 20__ to May 31, 20__ (the "Performance Period") as
described in Section 2 and (b) Recipient's continued employment during
the Performance Period as described in Section 3.  Recipient's "Dollar
Target Award" for purposes of this Agreement is $___________.

     2.     Revenue and EPS Performance Conditions.
            ______________________________________

            2.1   Subject to Section 3, the Dollar Target Award Payment
to be paid to Recipient shall be determined by multiplying the Payout
Factor by the Dollar Target Award.  The "Payout Factor" equals the
average of the Revenue-Related Percentage Level for the Performance
Period and the EPS-Related Percentage Level for the Performance Period.
The Revenue-Related Percentage Level for the Performance Period shall
be determined under the table below based on the Company's Cumulative
Revenue (as defined below) for the Performance Period.  The EPS-Related
Percentage Level for the Performance Period shall be determined under
the table below based on the Company's Cumulative EPS (as defined below)
for the Performance Period.  For example, if the Company's Cumulative
Revenue for the Performance Period is $_______ and the Company's
Cumulative EPS for the Performance Period is $_______, then the
Revenue-Related Percentage Level will be 110%, the EPS-Related
Percentage Level will be 140%, and the Payout Factor will therefore
equal 125%.

     If the Company's Cumulative Revenue is between any two data points
set forth in the first column of the above table, the Revenue-Related
Percentage Level shall be determined by interpolation between the
corresponding data points in the second column of the table as follows:
the difference between the Cumulative Revenue and the lower data point
shall be divided by the difference between the higher data point and
the lower data point, the resulting fraction shall be multiplied by the
difference between the two corresponding data points in the second
column of the table, and the resulting product shall be added to the
lower corresponding data point in the second column of the table, with
the resulting sum being the Revenue-Related Percentage Level.  If the
Company's Cumulative EPS is between any two data points set forth in
the third column of the above table, the EPS-Related Percentage Level
shall be similarly determined by interpolation between the
corresponding data points in the fourth column of the table.  For
example, if the Company's Cumulative Revenue is $_______ and the
Company's Cumulative EPS is $_______, then the Revenue-Related
Percentage Level will be 115%, the EPS-Related Percentage Level will be
135%, and the Payout Factor will therefore equal 125%.

            2.2   Subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 2.4,
2.5 and 2.6 below, the Company's "Cumulative Revenue" for the
Performance Period shall equal the sum of the Company's revenues for
the _______ fiscal years of the Company in the Performance Period.  For
this purpose, the Company's revenues for each fiscal year of the
Company during the Performance Period shall be as set forth in the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

            2.3   Subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 2.4,
2.5 and 2.6 below, the Company's "Cumulative EPS" for the Performance
Period shall equal the sum of the Company's diluted earnings per common
share for the _______ fiscal years of the Company in the Performance
Period.  The Company's diluted earnings per common share for each
fiscal year of the Company during the Performance Period shall be as
set forth in the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries.

            2.4   In the event that any acquisition of a business shall
occur during the Performance Period, the Company's Cumulative Revenue
for the Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to exclude
the revenues of the acquired business, and the Company's Cumulative EPS
for the Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to
approximate the Cumulative EPS as if the acquisition had not occurred,
by (a) excluding any costs of the acquisition recorded by the Company,
(b) excluding the operating income of the acquired business, (c)
reducing interest expense for any cash paid or debt incurred to fund
the acquisition based on the actual interest rate of such debt or the
Company's average interest rate for borrowed funds, (d) adjusting the
tax provision to reflect the adjusted amount of pre-tax income after
making the above adjustments, and (e) reducing weighted average shares
outstanding used for the EPS calculation by the number of Company
shares, if any, issued in the acquisition.

            2.5   In the event that any divestiture of a business shall
occur during the Performance Period, the Company's Cumulative Revenue
for the Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted as provided
in Section 2.5(i) below to reflect an assumed level of revenue of the
divested business for that portion of the Performance Period occurring
after the divestiture, and the Company's Cumulative EPS for the
Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted (a) to exclude any
gain or loss on the sale, (b) as provided in Section 2.5(ii) below to
reflect an assumed level of operating income of the divested business
for that portion of the Performance Period occurring after the
divestiture, (c) to reduce interest income for any cash or notes
received in the divestiture based on the actual interest rate on such
notes or the Company's average interest rate for borrowed funds, and (d)
to adjust the tax provision to reflect the adjusted amount of pre-tax
income after making the above adjustments.

                  (i)   The Company's Cumulative Revenue for the
Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to include the
Imputed Revenues of the divested business.  "Imputed Revenues" shall
mean the result obtained by multiplying the Average Daily Revenues of
the divested business by the number of calendar days in the Performance
Period occurring after the divestiture.  "Average Daily Revenues" shall
mean the result obtained by dividing (x) the revenues of the divested
business during that portion of the Performance Period occurring prior
to the divestiture by (y) the number of calendar days in the
Performance Period occurring prior to the divestiture.

                  (ii)  The Company's Cumulative EPS for the
Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the
Imputed Operating Income of the divested business.  "Imputed Operating
Income" shall mean the result obtained by multiplying the Average Daily
Operating Income of the divested business by the number of calendar
days in the Performance Period occurring after the divestiture.
"Average Daily Operating Income" shall mean the result obtained by
dividing (x) the operating income of the divested business during that
portion of the Performance Period occurring prior to the divestiture by
(y) the number of calendar days in the Performance Period occurring
prior to the divestiture.

            2.6   If the Company implements a change in accounting
principle during the Performance Period either as a result of issuance
of new accounting standards or otherwise, and the effect of the
accounting change was not reflected in the Company's business plan at
the time of approval of this award, then Cumulative Revenue and
Cumulative EPS shall be adjusted to eliminate the impact of the change
in accounting principle.

            2.7   All financial computations required to effect
adjustments pursuant to Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 shall be calculated
by the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied in a manner consistent with the application of such
principles to the preparation of the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.

     3.     Employment Condition.  In order to receive the Dollar
            ____________________
Target Award Payment determined under Section 2, Recipient must be
employed by the Company on the last day of the Performance Period.  If
Recipient's employment by the Company is terminated at any time prior
to the end of the Performance Period, for any reason or no reason, with
or without cause, including because of death or disability, Recipient
shall not be entitled to receive the Dollar Target Award Payment or any
portion thereof.

     4.     Certification and Payment.  As soon as practicable
            _________________________
following the completion of the audit of the Company's consolidated
financial statements for the final year of the Performance Period, the
Company shall calculate the Dollar Target Award Payment payable to
Recipient. This calculation shall be submitted to the Committee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce or eliminate the
calculated Dollar Target Award Payment based on circumstances relating
to the performance of the Company or Recipient.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if at any time during the Performance
Period Recipient's base pay is reduced or Recipient is assigned a
different title, job or set of responsibilities resulting in a decrease
in Recipient's level of responsibility for the Company (any such
reduction in base pay or assignment resulting in a decrease in
Recipient's level of responsibility for the Company, a "Demotion"), the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce or eliminate the
calculated Dollar Target Award Payment.  Recipient acknowledges and
agrees that, in the event the Committee reduces or eliminates the
calculated Dollar Target Award Payment in connection with any Demotion
occurring during the Performance Period, the Company intends for such
reduction or elimination to constitute the "proration" of Recipient's
Dollar Target Award with respect to such Demotion described in Plan-
related documents prepared by the Company and delivered to Recipient;
and that, in connection with any Demotion, in the event of any
inconsistency between the "proration" provisions of any such Plan-
related documents and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
of this Agreement shall control.

     The Committee shall certify in writing (which may consist of
approved minutes of a Committee meeting) the level of Cumulative
Revenue and Cumulative EPS attained by the Company and the Dollar
Target Award Payment (if any) payable to Recipient.  The Recipient
shall receive the Dollar Target Award Payment so certified, subject to
applicable tax withholding, in cash on August 15, 20__.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Recipient shall have made a valid
election to defer receipt of all or any portion of the Dollar Target
Award Payment pursuant to the terms of the Company's Deferred
Compensation Plan (a "Deferral Election"), payment of all or such
portion of the Dollar Target Award Payment so deferred shall be made in
accordance with the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the
Deferral Election.

     5.     Tax Withholding.  Recipient acknowledges that the amount of
            _______________
the Dollar Target Award Payment payable to Recipient (other than any
amount deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election) will be treated as
ordinary compensation income for federal and state income and FICA tax
purposes, and that the Company will be required to withhold taxes on
this income amount.

     6.     Promotions.  If at any time during the Performance Period
            __________
Recipient's base pay is increased or Recipient is assigned a different
title, job or set of responsibilities resulting in an increase in
Recipient's level of responsibility for the Company (any such increase
in base pay or assignment resulting in an increase in Recipient's level
of responsibility for the Company, a "Promotion"), the Company may, but
shall not be required to, grant to Recipient an additional award (the
"Mid-Plan Grant") on terms similar to those provided in this Agreement.
Any such Mid-Plan Grant shall constitute a grant separate from and
independent of the grant represented by this Agreement, and any such
Mid-Plan Grant shall not be granted under the Plan and shall not
qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the
Code.  The terms and conditions of any Mid-Plan Grant shall be set
forth in a separate, Mid-Plan Grant agreement between the Company and
Recipient in the form determined by the Company in its sole discretion
(a "Mid-Plan Grant Agreement").  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that
no Mid-Plan Grant shall be payable to Recipient unless Recipient
executes and delivers a Mid-Plan Grant Agreement in connection
therewith.  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any Mid-Plan Grant
granted to Recipient in connection with any Promotion during the
Performance Period will be intended to constitute the "proration" of
Recipient's Dollar Target Award with respect to such Promotion
described in Plan-related documents prepared by the Company and
delivered to Recipient; and that, in connection with any Promotion, in
the event of any inconsistency between the "proration" provisions of
any such Plan-related documents and the provisions of this Section 6
and the Mid-Plan Grant Agreement, the provisions of this Section 6 and
the Mid-Plan Grant Agreement shall control.

     7.     No Right to Employment.  Nothing contained in this
            ______________________
Agreement shall confer upon Recipient any right to be employed by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or to continue to provide services
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to interfere in any way
with the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate
Recipient's services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.
