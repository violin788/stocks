million in the prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 11
percent to $0.71, versus $0.64 last year.

Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our
second quarter was another great one, and it illustrates the ability of
our portfolio to deliver consistent, profitable growth.  Our strategy for
continued growth is very clear - commit totally to the consumer, deliver
innovative and relevant product, and focus our execution and discipline on
those parts of the business that offer the greatest growth opportunity."*

apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2007 through April 2008,

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 1 percent; Europe (which
includes the Middle East and Africa) increased 19 percent; Asia Pacific

Other Businesses
________________

Hurley International LLC and Exeter Brands Group LLC, grew 16 percent to
$613.7 million from $526.8 million last year. Pre-tax income increased 31
percent to $70.8 million for the quarter.

Following a strategic review of the Company's affiliate brands portfolio,
Nike management determined that Nike Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand
did not align with the Company's long-term growth priorities.  On November
15, 2007, the Company announced it had reached a definitive agreement to
sell the Starter brand to Iconix Brand Group for $60 million in cash. This
transaction was completed on December 17, 2007.  The Company is still
exploring the sale of the Bauer Hockey business.

On October 23, 2007, the Company announced it had reached an agreement on
an all-cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of Umbro
plc at 193.06 pence a share, which values the company at
(pound sterling) 282 million or approximately $570 million.
The acquisition will significantly expand Nike's global leadership in
football, a key growth category for the Company.

Commenting on these developments, Parker said: "Our focus on prime growth
opportunities extends throughout our portfolio of brands. We are confident
that our divestiture decisions this quarter are the right ones for Bauer
Hockey, for Starter, and for Nike.  As for Umbro, it is a brand that has
tremendous heritage and respect in global football. We're very excited
about leveraging those connections and bringing them to life in new ways
that will reward consumers and strengthen our competitive stance in
football around the world."*
