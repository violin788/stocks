Beaverton, OR (June 26, 2003) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
revenues and earnings for the Company's fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended May 31, 2003. Fourth quarter revenues increased 11 percent to
$3.0 billion, versus $2.7 billion for the same period last year.
Fourth quarter net income totaled $246.2 million, or $0.92 per diluted
share, compared to $208.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share in the
prior year.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003, revenues increased eight
percent to $10.7 billion, compared to $9.9 billion in fiscal year
2002. Full year income before accounting change totaled $740.1
million, or $2.77 per diluted share, versus $668.3 million, or $2.46
per diluted share, in 2002.  After a one-time charge from the
cumulative effect of implementing Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement 142 (Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets),
the Company posted net income of $474.0 million, or $1.77 per diluted
share versus $663.3 million in 2002.

Philip H. Knight, Chairman and CEO, said, "Nike's performance during
fiscal year 2003 was one for the record books, a year that positions
the company well for fiscal 2004.  We surpassed the $10 billion
revenue mark and delivered record earnings per share despite a
challenging geopolitical and economic environment.  This year's
results are a testament to the strong connection that the Nike brand
has with consumers around the world and our ability to drive
profitable growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses.  We are
optimistic that the combination of our global brand momentum, superior
product offerings and worldwide operating capability will generate
continued long-term growth." *


Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear
and apparel, scheduled for delivery between June and November 2003,
totaling $4.9 billion, 4.4 percent higher than such orders reported
for the same period last year.  Five points of this growth were due to
changes in currency exchange rates.*


By region, the USA was down 10 percent; Europe increased 17 percent;
Asia Pacific grew 20 percent; and the Americas increased 4 percent.
Of the growth in Europe, 13 points were due to currency exchange
rates.  Changes in currency exchange rates did not affect the Asia
Pacific growth rate.  The Americas had a one point decline due to
currency exchange rates. *

Knight said, "Our international futures orders were up 16%, driven by
great brand momentum around the world in football, running, and
basketball. While our USA futures orders declined, we remain
optimistic about the U.S. market.  Our brand presentation at retail is
improving and the USA region delivered its most profitable year in our
history." *
