Today NIKE, Inc. released the following press release:

                         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


        MEDIA CONTACT:                          INVESTOR CONTACT:
        Joani Komlos                            Pamela Catlett

                  NIKE, INC. TO ACQUIRE CONVERSE, INC.

Beaverton, OR (July 09, 2003) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) announced today
it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Converse, Inc.,
the globally recognized footwear brand with nearly a century of sports
heritage.  The total price to be paid for 100 percent of the equity
shares is approximately $305 million plus the assumption of certain
working capital liabilities at the time of the transaction's
consummation.

"Converse is one of the strongest footwear brands in the world with
great heritage and a long history of success," Tom Clarke, Nike's
President of New Business Ventures, said. "Converse's management has
done an excellent job of reestablishing this beloved brand with
consumers and we look forward to supporting them as they continue to
implement their growth strategy.  Converse shares our passion for sports
and, together, Nike and Converse will generate even greater access to a
dynamic consumer base."*

Jack Boys, Chief Executive Officer of Converse, said, "Over the past two
years, we have rebuilt and reinvigorated the Converse brand to it's
long-standing position as America's Original Sports Company, but our job
is not done.  Our core business in heritage products like Chuck
Taylor(registered) All Star(registered) and the Jack Purcell(registered)
combined with our traditional performance footwear offerings is a great
foundation upon which we plan to build and grow.  Our partnership with
Nike creates significant opportunity for us to execute our vision for
building a leading global sports footwear and apparel brand by growing
our core business and expanding our product offerings into other sports
performance and lifestyle categories."*

Clarke said, "The Nike brand has always been rooted in performance and
innovation. We enjoy a broad and deep connection with consumers around
the world which has generated over $9.5 billion in annual revenue under
the Nike brand.  Our strategy for growing through non-Nike brands is to
identify strong brands with superior management teams where Nike can
directly assist in the company's growth. Converse certainly meets our
criteria and its brand equity offers potential to drive even greater
revenue and earnings performance.  We believe the addition of Converse
to our increasingly diverse Nike, Inc. portfolio will contribute to
creating long-term shareholder value."*

Consummation of the agreement is subject to regulatory review, including
U.S. government review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger
Notification Act.
