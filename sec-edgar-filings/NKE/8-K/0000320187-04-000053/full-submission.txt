                        NIKE, INC.  ANNOUNCES ESTIMATED
                    THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $0.71 TO $0.74
                               PER DILUTED SHARE


Beaverton, OR (March 09, 2004) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today provided an
estimate of its financial expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2004,
which ended February 29, 2004.

For the third quarter, the company anticipates that its revenue will increase
more than 20 percent over the prior year.  Prior year revenues were unusually
low due to the timing of shipments related to the Company's supply chain
implementation in its European business.  While the Company does not intend
to begin the practice of providing earnings per share guidance, this revenue
increase would result in estimated third quarter earnings per share of
between $0.71 and $0.74 per diluted share.*

"Nike's businesses in the United States and Asia Pacific regions, combined
with favorable European currency exchange rates, are resulting in very
healthy revenue growth for the company," Philip H. Knight, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer said. "Consumer demand for Nike products continues to grow
as our innovative product and superior brand presence are generating renewed
energy in the footwear and apparel industry.  We remain optimistic that the
momentum we are seeing in our business is setting the stage for continued
profitable growth through the remainder of fiscal 2004."*

For the fourth quarter, the company has not adjusted its expectation of high
single digit revenue growth, year-over-year expansion of gross margins, and
continued investment in selling, general and administrative expenses in
excess of revenue growth.*

The company will release the financial results of its third quarter ended
February 29, 2004 on Thursday, March 18, 2004, at approximately 4:00 p.m.
EST.  Beginning at 5:00 p.m. EST, the Company will host a conference call to
discuss these results, which will be webcast live at www.nikebiz.com/invest.
It will be available for replay in an archived version at the same location
for one week.

product and key initiatives for the reporting period.
