                         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



          NIKE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.12

      Revenue up 11 percent; worldwide futures orders up 11.5 percent

       One-time tax benefit contributes $0.20 to earnings per share


BEAVERTON, Ore. (September 20, 2007) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
financial results for the first quarter, ended August 31, 2007. Revenue grew
11 percent to $4.7 billion, compared to $4.2 billion for the same period last
year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue growth by 3
percentage points for the quarter. First quarter net income increased 51
percent to $569.7 million, compared to $377.2 million in the prior year and
diluted earnings per share increased 51 percent to $1.12, versus $0.74 last
year.

The first quarter effective tax rate reflects a one-time benefit related to
utilization of past foreign losses, contributing $0.20 per diluted share.
The Company has now taken the steps necessary to realize this tax benefit,
reducing the effective tax rate for the quarter by approximately 15.6 points.

Mark Parker, President and CEO of Nike, Inc. said, "We're off to a strong
start as our first quarter results reflect the power of our brands as well as
the strength and diversification of the Nike, Inc. portfolio. We have an
aggressive growth plan to achieve $23 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2011,
and we're well on our way."*

Parker continued, "As we execute against our long-term growth priorities, we
will continue to distinguish ourselves as the industry leader with our
relentless focus on creating innovative product, and on bringing a new level
of excitement and energy to retail."*


Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2007 through January 2008,
totaling $5.9 billion, 11.5 percent higher than such orders reported for the
same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased reported
orders growth by 1 percentage point.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 3 percent; Europe (which
includes the Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific both increased 17
percent; and the Americas grew 20 percent. Changes in currency exchange rates
increased the reported futures orders growth in Europe by 3 percentage
points. Changes in currency exchange rates increased reported futures orders
growth in Asia Pacific by 1 percentage point. In the Americas region changes
in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on futures
growth.

Other Businesses
________________
For the first quarter, Other business revenues, which include Converse Inc.,
NIKE Golf, Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, NIKE Bauer Hockey Corp., Hurley
International LLC and Exeter Brands Group LLC, grew 12 percent to $628.7
million from $560.4 million last year. Pre-tax income increased 9 percent to
$95.2 million for the quarter. The prior year first quarter results included
a $14.2 million benefit resulting from the favorable settlement of
arbitration proceedings against Converse; excluding this benefit, pre-tax
income for the Other businesses grew 30 percent.

The Company also announced today its intent to explore the sale of Nike Bauer
Hockey. Following a strategic review of the company's affiliate brands
portfolio, Nike determined that despite the strength of the business, Nike
Bauer Hockey does not align with the Company's long-term growth priorities
and exploring a sale is the best strategic alternative. The Company expects
the exploration process and any potential sale that maximizes Nike Bauer
Hockey's value to Nike will be completed within the current fiscal year.

Commenting on the anticipated sale, Parker said: "We are focused on investing
our resources where we will achieve the greatest returns, both within the
Nike brand and within a strong portfolio of complementary affiliate brands.
We're confident it's the right choice for our Company as we maximize our
opportunities and drive toward our long-term growth targets. Given Nike
Bauers market leading position, we believe we will be able to effectively
execute this transaction."



Income Statement Review

Gross margins were 44.8 percent compared to 44.1 percent for the same period
last year.

Selling and administrative expenses were 30.8 percent of first quarter
revenues, which is comparable to the same period last year.

The effective tax rate for the first quarter declined significantly to 15.0
percent primarily due to the one-time tax benefit described above.


Balance Sheet Review

At quarter end, global inventories stood at $2.2 billion, an increase of less
than 1 percent from August 31, 2006.  Cash and short-term investments were
$2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, compared to $1.7 billion at the end
of the first quarter last year.


Share Repurchase

During the first quarter, the Company repurchased a total of 5,757,101 shares
for approximately $321.5 million in conjunction with the Company's four-year,
$3 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in
June 2006.  As of the end of the first quarter the Company has repurchased a
total of 23.8 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion under this
program.

order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter
