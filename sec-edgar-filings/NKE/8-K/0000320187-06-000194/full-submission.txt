          (i)     Each Bank may, in its sole discretion and not subject to
     the amount of its Commitment, make bids to make Competitive Bid Loans to
     the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.3.

          (ii)    In no event may the aggregate principal amount of all
     outstanding Advances (including both the Ratable Advances and the

(iii) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower may
     borrow, repay and re-borrow within the limits of each Bank's Commitment

each conversion and continuation with respect to a Ratable Advance, shall be

each Ratable Advance shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the last day of

          2.5.4   Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may, upon notice
                  ___________________________
to the Administrative Agent, from time to time pay all outstanding Ratable

<PAGE>

be prepaid prior to the last day of its applicable Interest Period without
the prior consent of the Bank which originally made such Loan, which consent
may be given or withheld at the Bank's sole and absolute discretion.  Any
prepayment of a Fixed Rate Advance prior to the end of an applicable Interest
Period shall be subject to the indemnification provided in Section 3.4.
                                                           ___________

          2.5.5   Interest Periods.  Subject to the provisions of Section
                  ________________                                _______
2.5.6, each Advance shall bear interest (i) with respect to any Floating Rate
_____
Advance, on the outstanding principal amount from the applicable borrowing
date until payment in full, and (ii) with respect to any other Advance, from
the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to the earlier of (a)
the last day of such Interest Period, or (b) the date of any earlier
prepayment as permitted by Section 2.5.4, at the interest rate determined as
                           _____________
applicable to such Advance, subject to the Borrower's right to convert or
continue Ratable Advances pursuant to Section 2.2.4.  The Borrower shall not
                                      _____________
request a Fixed Rate Advance if, after giving effect to the requested Fixed
Rate Advance, more than 20 separate Fixed Rate Advances would be outstanding.

          2.5.6   Rate after Maturity.  Except as provided in the next
                  ___________________
sentence, any Advance not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or
otherwise, shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate plus 1% per annum.  In the case of a Fixed Rate Advance the
maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest
for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period, at the higher of (a) the
rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 1% per annum, or (b)
the Base Rate plus 1% per annum.

          2.5.7   Interest Payment Dates; Interest Basis.  Interest accrued
                  ______________________________________
on each (i) Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date and
(ii) other Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable
Interest Period, and on any date on which such Advance is prepaid, whether
due to acceleration or otherwise.  Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate
Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be
payable on the last day of each three month interval during such Interest
Period.  Interest on all Floating Rate Advances calculated on the basis of
the Base Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed.  Interest on all
other Advances shall be calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed, which
results in a higher yield to the payee thereof than a method based on a year
of 365 or 366 days.  Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made
but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received
prior to 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) at the place of payment.  If any
payment of principal or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such
extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with
such payment.

          2.5.8   Method of Payment.  All payments to be made by the Borrower
                  _________________
shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense,
recoupment or setoff, without prejudice to Borrower's right to later assert
any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as specifically
provided in this Agreement and in the following sentence, all payments by the
Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the respective Banks to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative
Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than
11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the date when due and shall be applied (i)
first, ratably among the Banks with respect to any

                                     22

<PAGE>

principal and interest due in connection with Ratable Advances, (ii) second,
after all amounts described in clause (i) have been satisfied, ratably among
those Banks for whom any payment of principal and interest is due in
connection with any Competitive Bid Advances, and (iii) third, after all
                                                        _____
amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii) have been satisfied, ratably to any
other Obligations then due to the Banks.  If such payment is received by the
Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) such delivery to the
Banks shall be made on the same day and if received thereafter shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day.  The Administrative Agent is hereby
authorized to charge the account of the Borrower held at Bank of America for
each payment of principal, interest and fees owing by the Borrower as it
becomes due hereunder.

          2.5.9   Notes; Telephonic Notices; Designation of Borrower.  Each
                  __________________________________________________
Bank is hereby authorized to record on the schedule attached to each of its
Notes, or otherwise record in accordance with its usual practice, the date
and amount of each of its Loans of the type evidenced by such Note; provided,
                                                                    ________
however, that any failure to so record shall not affect the Borrower's
_______
Obligations under this Agreement or any Note.  The Borrower hereby authorizes
the Banks and the Administrative Agent to extend, continue and convert
Advances, effect Rate Option selections and submit Competitive Bid Quotes
based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative
Agent or any Bank in good faith believes to be an authorized officer or an
officer, employee or agent of the Borrower designated by an authorized
officer.  The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent
a written or telecopy confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an
authorized officer.  If the written or telecopy confirmation differs in any
material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the
Banks, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall govern
absent manifest error.

          2.5.10   Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments.
                   ________________________________________________________
The Administrative Agent will notify each Bank of the contents of each
Ratable Borrowing Notice, Notice of Conversion/Continuation (or automatic
conversion pursuant to Section 2.2.4(c)), and payment notice received by it
                       ________________
hereunder promptly and in any event (provided such items were timely received
by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower) before the close of business
on the same Business Day of receipt thereof (or, in the case of borrowing
notices with respect to Floating Rate Advances, within one hour of receipt
thereof).  The Administrative Agent will notify each Bank of the interest
rate applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of
such interest rate and will give each Bank prompt notice of each change in
the Base Rate in respect of any outstanding Floating Rate Advance.

          2.5.11   Non Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless
                   ________________________________________________
the Borrower or any Bank has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the
date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent
hereunder, that the Borrower or such Bank, as the case may be, will not make
such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such
Bank, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not
be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding
amount to the Person entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that such
payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds, then:

          (i)     if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Bank
     shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion
     of such assumed

                                     23

<PAGE>


     payment that was made available to such Bank in immediately available
     funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and
     including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative
     Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the
     Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds
     Rate from time to time in effect; and

          (ii)    if any Bank failed to make such payment, such Bank shall
     forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof
     in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the
     period from the date such amount was made available by the
     Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
     recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
                                                 ___________________
     rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
     effect. If such Bank pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then
     such amount shall constitute such Bank's Ratable Loan or Competitive Bid
     Loan, as the case may be, included in the applicable
     Borrowing.  If such Bank does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
     Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may
     make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay
     such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon
     for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of
     interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.  Nothing herein shall
     be deemed to relieve any Bank from its obligation to fulfill its
     Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or
     the Borrower may have against any Bank as a result of any default by
     such Bank hereunder.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Bank or the Borrower with respect
to any amount owing under this Section 2.5.11 shall be conclusive, absent
                               ______________
manifest error.

           2.5.12  Cancellation.  The Borrower may, at any time after the
                   ____________
Effective Date, upon not less than five Business Days' prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent, terminate or permanently reduce the Commitments
in whole, or in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000 (and in integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); unless, after giving effect
                                            ______
thereto and to any prepayments of Loans made on the effective date thereof,
the then-outstanding principal amount of the Loans would exceed the amount of
the combined Commitments then in effect.  All accrued commitment fees to, but
not including, the effective date of any reduction or termination of
Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or
termination.  Once the Commitments are reduced in accordance with this
Section, they may not be increased.

           2.5.13  Lending Offices.  Each Bank may from time to time, by
                   _______________
written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower,
change its Lending Office and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

           2.6.1   Requests for Extension.  The Borrower may, by notice to

<PAGE>

Termination Date then in effect hereunder (the "Existing Termination Date");
                                                _________________________
provided, that in no event shall the Termination Date be extended beyond
________
December 1, 2013.

           2.6.2   Bank Elections to Extend.  Each Bank, acting in its sole
                   ________________________
and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given
not later than the date (the "Notice Date") that is 10 Business Days after

an extension advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Bank agrees
to such extension and each Bank that determines not to so extend its
Termination Date (a "Non-Extending Bank") shall notify the Administrative
                     __________________
Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no
later than the Notice Date) and any Bank that does not so advise the
Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a
Non-Extending Bank.  The election of any Bank to agree to such extension
shall not obligate any other Bank to so agree.

           2.6.3   Notification by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative
                   ____________________________________
Agent shall notify the Borrower of each Bank's determination under this
Section no later than the date 30 days prior to the applicable Loan

           2.6.4   Additional Banks.  If (and only if) the Majority Banks
                   ________________
have agreed to extend their Termination Date, the Borrower shall have the
right on or before the Existing Termination Date to replace each Non-
Extending Bank with, and add as "Banks" under this Agreement in place
thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an "Additional Bank") as
                                                   _______________
provided in Section 3.7, each of which Additional Banks shall have entered
            ___________
into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Bank
shall, effective no later than the Existing Termination Date, undertake a
Commitment (and, if any such Additional Bank is already a Bank, its
Commitment shall be in addition to such Bank's Commitment hereunder on such
date).

           2.6.5   Minimum Extension Requirement.  If (and only if) the
                   _____________________________
Majority Banks have agreed so to extend their Termination Date immediately
prior to the applicable Loan Anniversary, then, the Termination Date of each
Extending Bank and of each Additional Bank shall be extended to the date
falling one year after the Existing Termination Date (except that, if such
date is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the
next preceding Business Day) and, as of the Existing Termination Date, each
Additional Bank shall become a "Bank" for all purposes of this Agreement.

           2.6.6   Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions.
                   _________________________________________

           2.6.7   Updated Schedule 3.  Promptly after each such extension,
                   __________________
the Administrative Agent shall prepare and deliver to each remaining Bank an
updated Schedule 3 to this Agreement, listing the Banks, Commitments and

     (a)     Any and all payments by the Borrower to each Bank or the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall

     (b)     If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold
any Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable hereunder to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, then:

          (i)     the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that,
     after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
     deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under
     this Section), such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
     be, receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have

     been imposed.

     (c)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and
the Administrative Agent for the full amount of (i) Indemnified Taxes, (ii)
Other Taxes, and (iii) Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank

     (d)     Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower of
Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish
to each Bank or the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of

assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
Bank in respect of Fixed Rate Advances (other than reserves and assessments
taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate
Advances), or

     (b)     imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
the cost to any Bank of making, funding or maintaining Fixed Rate Advances or
reduces any amount receivable by any Bank in connection with loans, or
requires any Bank to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount
of loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by
such Bank, or

     (c)     affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling any Bank and such Bank
determines the amount of capital required is increased by or based upon the
existence of this Agreement or its obligation to make Loans hereunder or of
commitments of this type,

then, within 15 days of demand by such Bank through the Administrative Agent,
the Borrower shall pay such Bank that portion of such increased expense
incurred (including, in the case of Section 3.2(c), any reduction in the rate
                                    ______________

in an amount received which such Bank determines is attributable to making,
funding and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Bank fails to make a claim within 90 days after it becomes,
or ought reasonably to have become, aware of any event giving rise to a claim
under this Section 3.2, then such Bank shall be entitled to make any claim
           ___________
under this Section 3.2 only in respect of any amounts due under this Section

day upon which the Bank makes such claim.

     3.3   Availability of Rate Options.  If any Bank determines that
           ____________________________
maintenance of any of its Fixed Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Office would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent
and the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected
Rate Option and require any Fixed Rate Advances outstanding under the
affected Rate Option to be repaid; or if any Bank determines that (i)
deposits of a type or maturity appropriate to match fund Fixed Rate Advances
are not available, the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of
the affected Rate Option with respect to any Fixed Rate Advances made after
the date of any such determination, or (ii) a Rate Option does not accurately
reflect the cost of making a Fixed Rate Advance at such Rate Option, such
Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent and then the Administrative
Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Rate Option with respect
to any Fixed Rate Advances made after the date of any such determination.

     3.4   Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance
           _______________________

Administrative Agent request the Borrower to pay and upon such request the

(i) (A) the Eurodollar Base Rate divided by (B) one minus the Reserve
                                                    _____
Requirement with respect to Eurocurrency liabilities (as defined in
Regulation D) over (ii) the Eurodollar Base Rate.  Any Bank wishing to

Eurodollar Ratable Loans of such Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the
place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period

      ___________    ___
under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not prohibited by
      ___________
applicable legal and regulatory restrictions and not disadvantageous to such

                                 ________________________

written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon
which such Bank determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.  Determination of
amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Fixed Rate Loan
shall be calculated as though each Bank funded its Fixed Rate Loan through
the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the
deposit used as a reference in determining the Fixed Rate for such Loan,
whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein,
the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable on demand
after receipt by the Borrower of the written statement.  The Obligations of

under Section 3.1 or 3.2, the Borrower may elect to remove such Bank as a

restrictions contained in, and the consents required by, Section 13.1), all

that (A) the Borrower notifies such Bank through the Administrative Agent of
such election at least five Business Days before any date fixed for a
borrowing, (B) (x) in the case of a removal, the Borrower promptly repays all
outstanding Obligations to such removed Bank or (y) in the case of an
assignment and delegation, such Bank shall have received payment of an amount
equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon,

principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (C) no Default or Unmatured Default exists.  Upon receipt

Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     5.3   No Conflict; Government Consent.  Neither the execution and
           _______________________________
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any Law, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the Borrower's or any
Subsidiary's articles of incorporation or bylaws or the provisions of any
indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is

with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the property of the Borrower or a

     8.1   Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.5 or 7.6
           ____________
occurs, the obligations of the Banks to make Loans to the Borrower hereunder
shall automatically terminate and the Obligations of the Borrower shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part
of the Administrative Agent or any Bank.  If any other Default occurs, the
Majority Banks may terminate the Commitments of the Banks, or declare the
Obligations of the Borrower to be due and payable, or both, whereupon such
Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby
expressly waives.

     If, within 14 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations
or termination of the Commitments of the Banks as a result of any Default
(other than any Default as described in Section 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 or 7.10) and
before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall
have been obtained or entered, the Majority Banks (in their sole discretion)
shall so direct the Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent
shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or
termination.

     8.2   Amendments and Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any provision
           ______________________
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure
by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the
Majority Banks and the Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent,
and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however,
that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

     (a)     waive any condition set forth in Section 4.1 without the written
consent of each Bank;

     (b)     extend or increase the Commitment of any Bank (except
reinstatement of any Commitment in accordance with Section 8.1) without the
written consent of such Bank;

     (c)     postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to
the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without
the written consent of each Bank directly affected thereby;

     (d)     reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
herein on, any Loan, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under
any other Loan Document, or change the manner of computation of any financial
ratio (including any change in any applicable defined term) used in
determining the Applicable Margin, Applicable Facility Fee Rate, or
Applicable Utilization Fee Rate, as the case may be, that would result in a
reduction of any interest rate on any Loan or any fee payable hereunder
without the written consent of each Bank directly affected thereby;

                                     41

<PAGE>



     (e)     change Section 2.5.8 or Section 12.2 in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written
consent of each Bank; or

     (f)     change any provision of this Section or the definition of
"Majority Banks" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Banks required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without
the written consent of each Bank;

provided, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Banks required above,
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document; and provided, further, that the Fee Letter may be
amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed
only by the parties thereto.

     8.3   Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Banks or the
           ______________________
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an
acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence
of a Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions
precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any
single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver,
amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the
Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the
Banks and the Administrative Agent required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then
only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and
all shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Banks until the
Obligations have been paid in full.

     (b)     Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Administrative Agent-Related Person, each Bank and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-
fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including
Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way
relating to or arising out of or in connection with (a) the execution,
delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan Document or
any other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment or Loan or the use or proposed use
of the proceeds therefrom, or (c) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding by third parties relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or
threatened claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively,
the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that such indemnity shall not, as
to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined  by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, subject to Oregon
Revised Statutes (section) 20.096.  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials
obtained through IntraLinks, electronic telecommunications, or other similar
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, nor shall
any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect, consequential or punitive
damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out
of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or
after the Closing Date).  All amounts due under this Section 10.7 shall be
payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor.  The agreements in
this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
replacement of any Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve

to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or
fiduciary relationship; and (v) each of the Administrative Agent and the

legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed
appropriate.  The Borrower hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any claims that it may have against the Administrative
Agent and each other agent party hereto with respect to any breach or alleged
breach of agency or fiduciary duty.

     10.19 USA PATRIOT Act Notice.  Each Bank that is subject hereto and the
           ______________________
Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Bank) hereby
notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT
Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the
"Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that

                                     47

<PAGE>


identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of
the Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance
with such Act.

                                 ARTICLE XI
                           THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
                           ________________________

     11.1  Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent.  Each Bank
           _____________________________________________________
hereby irrevocably, subject to Section 11.9, appoints, designates and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the
terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or
be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank or participant,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and
in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.  Instead, such term is
used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting
parties.

     11.2  Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of
           ____________________
its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     11.3  Liability of Administrative Agent.  No Administrative Agent-
           _________________________________
Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties
expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Bank
or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or for any failure of Borrower or any other party to any Loan
Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No
Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank
or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance
of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or

                                     48

<PAGE>


any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates thereof.

     11.4  Reliance by Administrative Agent.
           ________________________________

     (a)     The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel
to Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks as it
deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.  The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority Banks (or
such greater number of Banks as may be expressly required hereby in any
instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks.

     (b)     For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.1, each Bank that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with,
each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or
approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Bank unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from such Bank prior to the proposed Closing
Date specifying its objection thereto.

     11.5  Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
           _________________
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured
Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal,
interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Banks, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
written notice from a Bank or the Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default."  The Administrative Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of
any such notice.  The Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default as may be directed by the Majority Banks in
accordance with Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable
or in the best interest of the Banks.

     11.6  Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative
           ____________________________________________________________
Agent.  Each Bank acknowledges that no Administrative Agent-Related Person
_____
has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance
of any assignment or review of the affairs of Borrower and its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by any Administrative Agent-Related Person to any Bank as to any

                                     49

<PAGE>


matter, including whether Administrative Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession.  Each Bank represents to the
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Administrative Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder.  Each Bank
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Administrative Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the
Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of Borrower or any of its Affiliates which may
come into the possession of any Administrative Agent-Related Person.

     11.7  Indemnification of Administrative Agent.  Whether or not the
           _______________________________________
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify
upon demand each Administrative Agent-Related Person (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower and without limiting the obligation of
Borrower to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Administrative Agent-
Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred
by it; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to any
Administrative Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Administrative
Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided,
however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
Majority Banks shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for
its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney
Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or
referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.  The
undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the Commitments, the
payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative
Agent.

     11.8  Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity.  Bank of America and
           ___________________________________________
its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, acquire equity
interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial
advisory, underwriting or other business with Borrower and its Affiliates as
though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and

                                     50

<PAGE>

without notice to or consent of the Banks.  The Banks acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that
may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of Borrower or such
Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them.  With respect to its Loans,
Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as
any other Bank and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not
the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" include Bank of
America in its individual capacity.

     11.9  Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may, and
           ______________________________
at the request of the Majority Banks shall, resign as Administrative Agent
upon 30 days' notice to the Banks.  If the Administrative Agent resigns under
this Agreement, the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a
successor administrative agent for the Banks, which successor administrative
agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during
the existence of a Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor administrative agent is
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting
with the Banks and the Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among
the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of
the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall
mean such successor agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and Section 10.7
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  If no successor
administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the
date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of
the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as
the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

     11.10 Foreign Banks.  Each Bank that is a "foreign corporation,
           _____________
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code and that is entitled to
an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes or any treaty
to which such jurisdiction is a party with respect to payments hereunder or
under any Loan Documents shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to
receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or after
accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed
copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such
Person and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax on all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all
payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent that such Person is entitled to an exemption from, or
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax.  Thereafter and from time to time, each
such Person shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, (a) promptly submit
to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies
of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time
to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be

                                     51

<PAGE>


available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or
such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding
taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement, (b) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of
any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction, and (c) take such steps as shall not be materially
disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, and as may be
reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction
or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Person.  If such
Person, to the extent it may lawfully do so, fails to deliver the above forms
or other documentation, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable
withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without
reduction.  If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold any tax or other amount from payments made in
respect of such Person, such Person shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this
Section, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the
Administrative Agent.  The obligations of the Banks under this Section shall
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of
the Administrative Agent.

     11.11 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the
           _____________________________________________
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

     (a)     to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other
Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may
be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Banks and the
Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Banks and the Administrative
Agent and their respective agents and counsel, and all other amounts due the
Banks and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.4 and 10.7 allowed in
such judicial proceeding; and

     (b)     to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized
by each Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the
event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to the Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount
due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts
due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.4 and 10.7.

                                     53

composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Bank or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any
Bank in any such proceeding.

     11.12 Other Agents; Co-Lead Arrangers.  None of the Persons identified
           _______________________________
in this Agreement as a "Syndication Agent," "Co-Documentation Agent" or "Co-
Arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility
or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks as
such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Persons so identified
shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank.
Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of
the Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking action hereunder.

                             ARTICLE XII
                        SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS
                        ________________________

     12.1  Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
           ______
provided by law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any
Default occurs and is continuing, each Bank is authorized at any time and
from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice
being waived by the Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time
owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank, now or hereafter
existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such
Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Bank
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any
such set-off and application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

     12.2  Ratable Payments.  If any Bank, whether by setoff or otherwise,
           ________________
has payment made to it upon its Loans in a greater proportion than that
received by any other Bank (except as specifically contemplated by the terms
of this Agreement), such Bank agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a
portion of the Loans held by the other Banks so that after such purchase each
Bank will hold its ratable proportion of Loans.  If any Bank, whether in
connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or
such amounts which may be subject to set off, such Bank agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Banks share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In case
any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate
further adjustments shall be made.  Nothing in this Section shall impair the
right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may
have and apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of
indebtedness of the Borrower other than the Obligations.

           BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
           _________________________________________________

     13.1  Successors and Assigns.
           ______________________

     (a)     The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of each Bank and no Bank may assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee
in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section or (ii)
by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d)
of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to
the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (b)     Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or
a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided, that any such assignment shall be subject to the following
conditions: (i) (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an
Approved Fund with respect to a Bank, no minimum amount need be assigned and
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the
date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than
$10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not
apply to rights and obligations in respect of Competitive Bid Loans; (iii) no
consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by
subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition (A) the consent of the
Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be
required unless (1) a Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of
such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank
or an Approved Fund, and (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed shall be required if such
assignment is to a Person that is not a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an
Approved Fund with respect to a Bank; (iv) the parties to each assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500,
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion,
elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any
assignment (the assignee, if it is not a Bank, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a completed administrative questionnaire in a form
supplied by the Administrative Agent); (v) no such assignment shall be made

                                    54

<PAGE>


to the Borrower or any of Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries; and (vi) no
such assignment shall be made to a natural person.  Subject to acceptance and
recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of
this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
and Assumption, the assignee thereunder, if not already a party hereto, shall
become a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Bank
under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from
its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 10.7 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such assignment).  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute
and deliver a Note to the assignee Bank. Any assignment or transfer by a Bank
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Bank of a participation in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

     (c)     The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (d)     Any Bank may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
Affiliates or Subsidiaries ) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of
such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or
a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided, that (i)
such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a
participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
of any  provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described
in the first proviso to Section 8.2 that affects such Participant.  Subject
to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4, and shall be
bound by the obligations set forth in Section 3.6, to the same extent as if
it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each

                                     55

<PAGE>


Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.1 as though
it were a Bank, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section
12.2 as though it were a Bank.

     (e)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.1 or 3.4 than the applicable Bank would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Borrower's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a
Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 3.1 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to
comply with Section 11.10 as though it were a Bank.

     (f)     Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its
Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, that no
such pledge or assignment shall release such Bank from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party
hereto.

     (g)     The words "execution," "signed," "signature" and words of like
import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic
signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall
be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually
executed signature or the use of paper-based recordkeeping system, as the
case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law,
including the Federal Electronic Signatures and Global and National Commerce
Act or any state Laws based on or substantially similar to the Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act.

     (h)     As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

"Eligible Assignee" means  any Person that meets the requirements to be an
assignee under Section 13.1(b)(iii), (v) and (vi) (subject to such consents,
if any, as may be required under Section 13.1(b)(iii)).

"Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or will be)
engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial
loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business.

"Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a Bank,
(b) an Affiliate of a Bank or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that
administers or manages a Bank.

Re:    Opinion of Counsel

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     I serve as General Counsel of NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the
"Borrower").  In that capacity, I provide this Opinion Letter in connection
with the Credit Agreement dated as of even date herewith among the Borrower,
Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the Banks named therein,
providing for loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding
$1,000,000,000 at any one time outstanding, and the Ratable Notes and
Competitive Bid Notes executed in connection therewith (collectively, the
"Agreement").  Capitalized terms used in this Opinion Letter are defined as
set forth in the Agreement or the Accord (see below).

     This Opinion Letter is governed by, and shall be interpreted in
accordance with, the Legal Opinion Accord (the "Accord") of the ABA Section
of Business Law (1991).  As a consequence, it is subject to a number of
qualifications, exceptions, definitions, limitations on coverage and other
limitations, all as more particularly described in the Accord, and this
Opinion Letter should be read in conjunction therewith.  The Law covered by
the opinions expressed herein is limited to the Federal Laws of the United
States and the Law of the State of Oregon.  This Opinion Letter is limited to
matters about which I possess Actual Knowledge.

     Based on and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:


     1.     The Agreement is enforceable against the Borrower.

     2.     Execution and delivery by the Borrower of, and performance of its
agreements in, the Agreement do not (i) violate its Constituent Documents,
(ii) breach or result in a default under any existing obligation of the
Borrower, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien,
under any contract filed by the Borrower with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, or (iii) breach or otherwise violate any existing
obligation of the Borrower under any Court Order.

     3.     Execution and delivery by the Borrower of, and performance by the
Borrower of its agreements in, the Agreement do not violate applicable
provisions of statutory law or regulation.

     4.     There are no actions or proceedings against the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries pending, or overtly threatened in writing, before any
court, governmental agency or arbitrator which (a) seek to affect the
enforceability of the Agreement, or (b) would result in a material adverse
effect on the business or financial condition of the Borrower.

     The General Qualifications apply to the opinions set forth in paragraphs
1 and 3 above and the Other Common Qualifications apply to all of the
opinions set forth above.  This Opinion Letter may be relied upon only by you
and your assignees and the Banks in connection with the Transaction and may
