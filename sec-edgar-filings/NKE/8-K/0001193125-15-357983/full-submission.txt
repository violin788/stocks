the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in
paragraph&nbsp;(a) or (b)&nbsp;above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party&#146;s choice at the indemnifying party&#146;s expense to represent the indemnified party in any
action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by
the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party&#146;s election to appoint counsel

of such separate counsel if (i)&nbsp;the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii)&nbsp;the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any
such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of
the institution of such action or (iv)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party; provided, however, that an indemnifying party shall not be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one such separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or reasonable expense by
reason of such settlement or judgment subject to and in accordance with paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;8, as applicable. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are
actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not
include any statement as to, or any admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. </P>

liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively &#147;Losses&#148;) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion

provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission, as the case may be, applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter

not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total
underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph&nbsp;(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director,
officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company
who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph&nbsp;(d). </P>

delivered by and between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the &#147;<B>Trustee</B>&#148;), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October&nbsp;29, 2015 (the &#147;<B>Second Supplemental
Indenture</B>&#148;), by and between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture as supplemented and amended by the Second Supplemental Indenture is referred to herein as the &#147;Indenture.&#148; By the terms of the Base Indenture, the debt
securities issuable thereunder are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture. This security is one of the series designated on the face hereof
(individually, a &#147;<B>Security</B>,&#148; and collectively, the &#147;<B>Securities</B>&#148;), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the

3.875%. The Company will pay interest semi-annually on May&nbsp;1 and November&nbsp;1 of each year (each such day, an &#147;<B>Interest Payment Date</B>&#148;). If any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity of this Security is
not a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue for the period
after such date to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of
issuance; provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a regular record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall
accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; and provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be May&nbsp;1, 2016. Interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. All dollar amounts

the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the Indenture. If any of the Notes are no longer represented by a Global Security, payment of interest on certificated Notes in definitive form may, at the option of
