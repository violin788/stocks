     (1)     The Committee established a series of performance targets based on
             revenues and earnings per share for each applicable performance
             period corresponding to award payouts ranging from 0% to 150% of
             the target awards.  Under the terms of the awards, on August 15 of
             the last year of the applicable performance period participants
             will be issued a payout at the average of the percentage levels
             corresponding to the results for the two targets, subject to the
             Committee's discretion to reduce or eliminate any award based on
             Company or individual performance.  A portion of the payout equal
             to the required tax withholding will be payable in cash and used
             to satisfy the withholding.  The balance of the payout will be
             payable at the election of the participant in either (a) cash, (b)
             shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company valued at the
             closing price of the Class B Common Stock on the New York Stock
             Exchange on the payout date, or (c) a mix of cash and shares.  The
             cash and shares will be 100% vested at that time.  The awards to
             Mr. Perez were required pursuant to the terms of Mr. Perez's
             employment agreement with the Company, a copy of which was filed
             as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated

                               NIKE, INC.

               FY '__-'__ LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD AGREEMENT

     This FY '__-'__ Long-Term Incentive Award Agreement (this
"Agreement") is entered into as of _____________, 20__, between NIKE,
Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and _______________
("Recipient").

     On _________, 20__, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee")
of the Company's Board of Directors authorized a performance-based
award to Recipient pursuant to Section 6 of the Company's Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  Compensation paid pursuant to the award
is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Recipient desires to accept the award subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

     1.     Award.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
            _____
Agreement, the Company shall pay to Recipient the dollar amount (the
"Dollar Target Award Payment") determined under this Agreement based on
(a) the Company's financial performance during the _____-year period
from June 1, 20__ to May 31, 20__ (the "Performance Period") as
described in Section 2 and (b) Recipient's continued employment during
the Performance Period as described in Section 3.  Recipient's "Dollar
Target Award" for purposes of this Agreement is $_______________.

     2.     Revenue and EPS Performance Conditions.
            ______________________________________

          2.1     Subject to Section 3, the Dollar Target Award Payment
to be paid to Recipient shall be determined by multiplying the Payout
Factor by the Dollar Target Award.  The "Payout Factor" equals the
average of the Revenue-Related Percentage Level for the Performance
Period and the EPS-Related Percentage Level for the Performance Period.
The Revenue-Related Percentage Level for the Performance Period shall
be determined under the table below based on the Company's Cumulative
Revenue (as defined below) for the Performance Period.  The EPS-Related
Percentage Level for the Performance Period shall be determined under
the table below based on the Company's Cumulative EPS (as defined below)
for the Performance Period.  For example, if the Company's Cumulative
Revenue for the Performance Period is $_______ and the Company's
Cumulative EPS for the Performance Period is $_______, then the
Revenue-Related Percentage Level will be 110%, the EPS-Related
Percentage Level will be 140%, and the Payout Factor will therefore
equal 125%.

</TABLE>

     If the Company's Cumulative Revenue is between any two data points
set forth in the first column of the above table, the Revenue-Related
Percentage Level shall be determined by interpolation between the
corresponding data points in the second column of the table as follows:
the difference between the Cumulative Revenue and the lower data point
shall be divided by the difference between the higher data point and
the lower data point, the resulting fraction shall be multiplied by the
difference between the two corresponding data points in the second
column of the table, and the resulting product shall be added to the
lower corresponding data point in the second column of the table, with
the resulting sum being the Revenue-Related Percentage Level.  If the
Company's Cumulative EPS is between any two data points set forth in
the third column of the above table, the EPS-Related Percentage Level
shall be similarly determined by interpolation between the
corresponding data points in the fourth column of the table.  For
example, if the Company's Cumulative Revenue is $_______ and the
Company's Cumulative EPS is $_______, then the Revenue-Related
Percentage Level will be 115%, the EPS-Related Percentage Level will be
135%, and the Payout Factor will therefore equal 125%.

          2.2     Subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 2.4,
2.5 and 2.6 below, the Company's "Cumulative Revenue" for the
Performance Period shall equal the sum of the Company's revenues for
the _____ fiscal years of the Company in the Performance Period.  For
this purpose, the Company's revenues for each fiscal year of the
Company during the Performance Period shall be as set forth in the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

          2.3     Subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 2.4,
2.5 and 2.6 below, the Company's "Cumulative EPS" for the Performance
Period shall equal the sum of the Company's diluted earnings per common
share for the _____ fiscal years of the Company in the Performance
Period.  The Company's diluted earnings per common share for each
fiscal year of the Company during the Performance Period shall be as
set forth in the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries.

          2.4     In the event that any acquisition of a business shall
occur during the Performance Period, the Company's Cumulative Revenue
for the Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to exclude
the revenues of the acquired business, and the Company's Cumulative EPS
for the Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to
approximate the Cumulative EPS as if the acquisition had not occurred,
by (a) excluding any costs of the acquisition recorded by the Company,
(b) excluding the operating income of the acquired business, (c)
reducing interest expense for any cash paid or debt incurred to fund
the acquisition based on the actual interest rate of such debt or the
Company's average interest rate for borrowed funds, (d) adjusting the
tax provision to reflect the adjusted amount of pre-tax income after
making the above adjustments, and (e) reducing weighted average shares
outstanding used for the EPS calculation by the number of Company
shares, if any, issued in the acquisition.

          2.5     In the event that any divestiture of a business shall
occur during the Performance Period, the Company's Cumulative Revenue
for the Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted as provided
in Section 2.5(i) below to reflect an assumed level of revenue of the
divested business for that portion of the Performance Period occurring
after the divestiture, and the Company's Cumulative EPS for the
Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted (a) to exclude any
gain or loss on the sale, (b) as provided in Section 2.5(ii) below to
reflect an assumed level of operating income of the divested business
for that portion of the Performance Period occurring after the
divestiture, (c) to reduce interest income for any cash or notes
received in the divestiture based on the actual interest rate on such
notes or the Company's average interest rate for borrowed funds, and (d)
to adjust the tax provision to reflect the adjusted amount of pre-tax
income after making the above adjustments.

               (i)     The Company's Cumulative Revenue for the
Performance Period shall be appropriately adjusted to include the
Imputed Revenues of the divested business.  "Imputed Revenues" shall
mean the result obtained by multiplying the Average Daily Revenues of
the divested business by the number of calendar days in the Performance
Period occurring after the divestiture.  "Average Daily Revenues" shall
mean the result obtained by dividing (x) the revenues of the divested
business during that portion of the Performance Period occurring prior
to the divestiture by (y) the number of calendar days in the
Performance Period occurring prior to the divestiture.

               (ii)    The Company's Cumulative EPS for the Performance
Period shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the Imputed Operating
Income of the divested business.  "Imputed Operating Income" shall mean
the result obtained by multiplying the Average Daily Operating Income
of the divested business by the number of calendar days in the
Performance Period occurring after the divestiture.  "Average Daily
Operating Income" shall mean the result obtained by dividing (x) the
operating income of the divested business during that portion of the
Performance Period occurring prior to the divestiture by (y) the number
of calendar days in the Performance Period occurring prior to the
divestiture.

          2.6     If the Company implements a change in accounting
principle during the Performance Period either as a result of issuance
of new accounting standards or otherwise, and the effect of the
accounting change was not reflected in the Company's business plan at
the time of approval of this award, then Cumulative Revenue and
Cumulative EPS shall be adjusted to eliminate the impact of the change
in accounting principle.

          2.7     All financial computations required to effect
adjustments pursuant to Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 shall be calculated
by the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied in a manner consistent with the application of such
principles to the preparation of the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.

     3.     Employment Condition.  In order to receive the Dollar
            ____________________
Target Award Payment determined under Section 2, Recipient must be
employed by the Company on the last day of the Performance Period.  If
Recipient's employment by the Company is terminated at any time prior
to the end of the Performance Period, for any reason or no reason, with
or without cause, including because of death or disability, Recipient
shall not be entitled to receive the Dollar Target Award Payment or any
portion thereof.


     4.     Certification and Payment.  As soon as practicable
            _________________________
following the completion of the audit of the Company's consolidated
financial statements for the final year of the Performance Period, the
Company shall calculate the Dollar Target Award Payment payable to
Recipient. This calculation shall be submitted to the Committee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce or eliminate the
calculated Dollar Target Award Payment based on circumstances relating
to the performance of the Company or Recipient.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if at any time during the Performance
Period Recipient's base pay is reduced or Recipient is assigned a
different title, job or set of responsibilities resulting in a decrease
in Recipient's level of responsibility for the Company (any such
reduction in base pay or assignment resulting in a decrease in
Recipient's level of responsibility for the Company, a "Demotion"), the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce or eliminate the
calculated Dollar Target Award Payment.  Recipient acknowledges and
agrees that, in the event the Committee reduces or eliminates the
calculated Dollar Target Award Payment in connection with any Demotion
occurring during the Performance Period, the Company intends for such
reduction or elimination to constitute the "proration" of Recipient's
Dollar Target Award with respect to such Demotion described in Plan-
related documents prepared by the Company and delivered to Participant;
and that, in connection with any Demotion, in the event of any
inconsistency between the "proration" provisions of any such Plan-
related documents and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
of this Agreement shall control.

     The Committee shall certify in writing (which may consist of
approved minutes of a Committee meeting) the level of Cumulative
Revenue and Cumulative EPS attained by the Company and the Dollar
Target Award Payment (if any) payable to Recipient.  A portion of the
Dollar Target Award Payment so certified, which portion shall be equal
to the required tax withholding amount on the Dollar Target Award
Payment, shall be payable in cash and shall be used to satisfy such
required tax withholding, as provided in Section 5 below.  The
Recipient may elect to receive the balance of the Dollar Target Award
Payment (the "Dollar Target Award Payment Balance") in either (a) cash,
(b) shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company ("Performance Shares")
valued at the closing price of the Class B Common Stock as reported by
the New York Stock Exchange on August 15, 20__, or (c) a specified
percentage in cash and a specified percentage in Performance Shares.
The Recipient's election regarding the form of payment (the "Election")
must be in writing or such other form as may be specified by the
Company and must be delivered by Recipient to the Company no later than
July 31, 20__.  If Recipient does not timely deliver the Election, the
Dollar Target Award Payment Balance shall be paid in the form of
Performance Shares.  The portion, if any, of the Dollar Target Award
Payment Balance payable to Recipient in cash shall be paid on August 15,
20__.  The portion, if any, of the Dollar Target Award Payment Balance
payable to Recipient in Performance Shares shall be delivered to
Recipient as soon as practicable after August 15, 20__.  No fractional
shares shall be delivered to Recipient in connection with the Dollar
Target Award Payment and the number of Performance Shares deliverable
shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Recipient shall have made a valid election to defer
receipt of all or any portion of the Dollar Target Award Payment
pursuant to the terms of the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan (a
"Deferral Election"), payment of all or such portion of the Dollar
Target Award Payment so deferred shall be made in accordance with the
terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Deferral Election.


     5.     Tax Withholding.  Recipient acknowledges that the amount of
            _______________
the Dollar Target Award Payment payable to Recipient (other than any
amount deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election) will be treated as
ordinary compensation income for federal and state income and FICA tax
purposes, and that the Company will be required to withhold taxes on
this income amount.  To satisfy the required withholding amount, the
Company shall withhold all or part of that portion of the Dollar Target
Award Payment that is payable in cash.

     6.     Promotions.  If at any time during the Performance Period
            __________
Recipient's base pay is increased or Recipient is assigned a different
title, job or set of responsibilities resulting in an increase in
Recipient's level of responsibility for the Company (any such increase
in base pay or assignment resulting in an increase in Recipient's level
of responsibility for the Company, a "Promotion"), the Company may, but
shall not be required to, grant to Recipient an additional award (the
"Mid-Plan Grant") on terms similar to those provided in this Agreement,
except that any such award shall be payable solely in cash.  Any such
Mid-Plan Grant shall constitute a grant separate from and independent
of the grant represented by this Agreement, and any such Mid-Plan Grant
shall not be granted under the Plan and shall not qualify as
performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.  The
terms and conditions of any Mid-Plan Grant shall be set forth in a
separate, Mid-Plan Grant agreement between the Company and Recipient in
the form determined by the Company in its sole discretion (a "Mid-Plan
Grant Agreement").  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that no Mid-Plan
Grant shall be payable to Recipient unless Recipient executes and
delivers a Mid-Plan Grant Agreement in connection therewith.  Recipient
acknowledges and agrees that any Mid-Plan Grant granted to Recipient in
connection with any Promotion during the Performance Period will be
intended to constitute the "proration" of Recipient's Dollar Target
Award with respect to such Promotion described in Plan-related
documents prepared by the Company and delivered to Recipient; and that,
in connection with any Promotion, in the event of any inconsistency
between the "proration" provisions of any such Plan-related documents
and the provisions of this Section 6 and the Mid-Plan Grant Agreement,
the provisions of this Section 6 and the Mid-Plan Grant Agreement shall
control.

     7.     Changes in Capital Structure.  If the outstanding Class B
            ____________________________
Common Stock of the Company is hereafter increased or decreased or
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
other securities of the Company by reason of any stock split,
combination of shares or dividend payable in shares, recapitalization
or reclassification, appropriate adjustment shall be made by the
Committee in the number and kind of shares subject to this Agreement so
that Recipient's proportionate interest before and after the occurrence
of the event is maintained.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee shall have no obligation to effect any adjustment that would
or might result in the issuance of fractional shares, and any
fractional shares resulting from any adjustment may be disregarded or
provided for in any manner determined by the Committee.  Any such
adjustments made by the Committee shall be conclusive.

     8.     Approvals.  The obligations of the Company under this
            _________
Agreement are otherwise subject to the approval of state and federal
authorities or agencies with jurisdiction in the matter.  The Company
will use its best efforts to take steps required by state or federal
law or applicable regulations, including rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock exchange on which the
Company's Class B Common Stock may then be listed, in connection with
the award under this Agreement.  The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be obligated to issue or deliver Class B Common Stock
under this Agreement if such issuance or delivery would violate
applicable state or federal law.

     9.     No Right to Employment.  Nothing contained in this
            ______________________
Agreement shall confer upon Recipient any right to be employed by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or to continue to provide services
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to interfere in any way
with the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate
Recipient's services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.

Exhibit 10.2

                             NIKE, INC.

                  RESTRICTED STOCK BONUS AGREEMENT


     This Agreement is entered into as of _______, 200_, between NIKE,
Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and _____________ (the
"Recipient").

     The Company has awarded a restricted stock bonus to the Recipient
pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Company's 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the
"Plan") and Recipient desires to accept the award subject to the terms
and conditions of this agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1.     Award of Restricted Stock Bonus.  Subject to the terms and
       _______________________________
conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the
Recipient _______ shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company (the
"Restricted Shares").  The Restricted Shares are subject to forfeiture
to the Company as set forth in Section 3 below.

2.     Vesting.
       _______

     2.1     Generally.  All of the Restricted Shares shall initially
             _________
be unvested, and shall vest with respect to _________ of the total
Restricted Shares on each of the anniversaries of the date of this
Agreement.

     2.2     Acceleration Upon Death or Disability.  If the Recipient
             _____________________________________
ceases to be employed by or in the service of the Company or any parent
or subsidiary corporation of the Company as a result of death or
physical disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), all of the Restricted
Shares shall immediately vest.


     2.3     Special Acceleration in Certain Events.  All of the
             ______________________________________
Restricted Shares shall immediately vest at any time when the
shareholders of the Company approve an Approved Transaction.  For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Approved Transaction" means (a)
any consolidation, merger, plan of exchange or transaction involving
the Company (a "Merger") in which the Company is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or pursuant to which the Common Stock of the
Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property,
other than a Merger involving the Company in which the holders of the
Common Stock of the Company immediately prior to the Merger have the
same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving
corporation after the Merger, or (b) any sale, lease, exchange or other
transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of
all or substantially all of the  assets of the Company or the adoption
of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the
Company.

3.     Forfeiture Restriction.  If the Recipient ceases to be employed
       ______________________
by or in the service of the Company or any parent or subsidiary
corporation of the Company for any reason or for no reason, with or
without cause, any Restricted Shares that did not vest pursuant to
Section 2 above at or prior to the time of such termination of
employment or service shall be forfeited to the Company.  Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Recipient any right to be
employed by the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the
Company or to continue to provide services to the Company or any parent
or subsidiary corporation of the Company or to interfere in any way
with the right of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation
of the Company to terminate Recipient's services at any time for any
reason, with or without cause.

4.     Restriction on Transfer.  The Recipient shall not sell, assign,
       _______________________
pledge, or in any manner transfer unvested Restricted Shares, or any
right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, whether voluntarily or
by operation of law, or by gift, bequest or otherwise.  Any sale or
transfer, or purported sale or transfer, of unvested Restricted Shares,
or any right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, in violation of
this Section 4 shall be null and void.

5.     Tax Withholding.  Recipient acknowledges that, on the date (the
       _______________
"Vesting Date") any portion of the Restricted Shares vests, the Value
(as defined below) on that date of such vested Restricted Shares will
be treated as ordinary compensation income for federal and state income
and FICA tax purposes, and that the Company will be required to
withhold taxes on this income amount.  To satisfy the required
withholding amount, Recipient shall surrender to the Company the number
of vested Restricted Shares having a Value equal to the required
withholding amount, and the Company shall have the right to cancel such
number of vested Restricted Shares without any further action by
Recipient before delivering the balance of the vested Restricted Shares
to Recipient in accordance with Section 7.  For purposes of this
Section 5, the "Value" of a Restricted Share shall be equal to the
closing market price for Class B Common Stock on the last trading day
preceding the Vesting Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient
may elect with respect to any Vesting Date to pay withholding taxes in
cash instead of having vested Restricted Shares withheld to cover taxes
by giving notice to the Company in writing at least 15 days prior to
the Vesting Date, in which case no vested Restricted Shares shall be
delivered to Recipient until Recipient shall have paid to the Company
in cash any required tax withholding.  Recipient agrees not to file
with respect to any Restricted Shares any election under Section 83(b)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

6.     Rights as Shareholder; Dividends.  Upon the execution and
       ________________________________
delivery of this Agreement, the award of the Restricted Shares shall be
completed and, except as limited by this Agreement, the Recipient shall
be the owner of the Restricted Shares with all rights of a shareholder,
including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and to receive
ordinary dividends payable with respect to the Restricted Shares from
the date of this Agreement.  Until the Restricted Shares become vested,
they will not be treated as issued shares for federal income tax
purposes and dividends paid to the Recipient with respect to the
Restricted Shares will be treated for federal income tax purposes as
additional compensation subject to applicable withholding.

7.     Stock Certificate.  To secure the rights of the Company under
       _________________
Sections 3 and 5, the Company will retain the certificate or
certificates representing the Restricted Shares.  Upon any forfeiture
of the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement, the Company shall
have the right to cancel the Restricted Shares in accordance with this
Agreement without any further action by the Recipient.  After
Restricted Shares have vested and all required withholding has been
paid to the Company in connection with such vesting, the Company shall
deliver a certificate for the remaining vested Restricted Shares to the
Recipient.

8.     Additional Company Shares.  If, prior to vesting of Restricted
       _________________________
Shares, the outstanding Class B Common Stock is increased as a result
of a stock dividend or stock split, the restrictions and other
provisions of this Agreement shall apply to any such additional shares
of Class B Common Stock which are issued in respect of the Restricted
Shares to the same extent as such restrictions and other provisions
apply to the Restricted Shares.

9.     Restrictive Legends.  Stock certificates for shares issued under
       ___________________
this Agreement may bear the following legends:

          The shares represented by this certificate are subject to a
     Restricted Stock Bonus Agreement between the registered owner and
     NIKE, Inc. which restricts the transferability of the shares.  A
     copy of the agreement is on file with the Secretary of NIKE, Inc.

10.    Miscellaneous.

       10.1     Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement
                ___________________________

                               NIKE, INC.
                      1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
                 NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     Pursuant to the 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") of NIKE, Inc., an
Oregon corporation (the "Company"), the Company grants to ___________________
(the "Optionee") the right and the option (the "Option") to purchase all or
any part of ____ shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock at a purchase
price of $______ per share, subject to the terms and conditions of this
agreement between the Company and the Optionee (this "Agreement").  By
accepting this Option grant, the Optionee agrees to all of the terms and
conditions of the Option grant.  The terms and conditions of the Option grant
set forth in attached Exhibit A are incorporated into and made a part of this
Agreement.

     1.     Grant Date; Expiration Date.  The Grant Date for this Option is
_________, which was the date of the Company's 20___ annual meeting of
shareholders.  The Option shall continue in effect until _________ (the
"Expiration Date") unless earlier terminated as provided in Sections 1, 4 or
5 of Exhibit A.  The Option shall not be exercisable on or after the
Expiration Date.

     2.     Vesting of Option.  Until it expires or is terminated as provided
in Sections 1, 4 or 5 of Exhibit A, the Option may be exercised from time to
time to purchase whole shares as to which it has become exercisable.  The
Option shall become exercisable for 100% of the shares on the date of the
first annual meeting of shareholders of the Company held after the Grant
Date.

     3.     Non-Statutory Stock Option.  The Company hereby designates the
Option to be a non-statutory stock option, rather than an Incentive Stock
Option as defined in Section 422 of the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended.

                                          NIKE, Inc.
                                          By:______________________________
                                             William D. Perez,
                                             Chief Executive Officer



                                NIKE, INC.

                               EXHIBIT A TO
                        1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
                  NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     1.     Termination of Employment or Service.

            1.1     General Rule.  Except as provided in this Section 1, the
Option may not be exercised unless at the time of exercise the Optionee is
employed by or in the service of the Company and shall have been so employed
or provided such service continuously since the Grant Date.  For purposes of
this Exhibit A, the Optionee is considered to be employed by or in the
service of the Company if the Optionee is employed by or in the service of
the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company (an
"Employer").

            1.2     Termination Generally. If the Optionee's employment or
service with the Company terminates for any reason other than because of the
Optionee's total disability or death as provided in Sections 1.3 or 1.4, the
Option may be exercised at any time before the Expiration Date or the
expiration of three months after the date of termination, whichever is the
shorter period, but only if and to the extent the Optionee was entitled to
exercise the Option at the date of termination.

            1.3     Termination Because of Total Disability. If the
Optionee's employment or service with the Company terminates because of total
disability, the Option shall immediately become exercisable in full and may
be exercised at any time before the Expiration Date or before the date that
is one year after the date of termination, whichever is the shorter period.
The term "total disability" means a medically determinable mental or physical
impairment that is expected to result in death or has lasted or is expected
to last for a continuous period of 12 months or more and that, in the opinion
of the Company and two independent physicians, causes the Optionee to be
unable to perform duties as an employee, director, officer or consultant of
the Employer and unable to be engaged in any substantial gainful activity.
Total disability shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day after the
two independent physicians have furnished their written opinion of total
disability to the Company and the Company has reached an opinion of total
disability.

            1.4     Termination Because of Death.  If the Optionee dies while
employed by or in the service of the Company, the Option shall immediately
become exercisable in full and may be exercised at any time before the
Expiration Date or before the date that is one year after the date of death,
whichever is the shorter period, but only by the person or persons to whom
the Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by the Optionee's will or
by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of domicile
at the time of death.

            1.5     Absence on Leave.  Absence on leave or on account of
illness or disability under rules established by the committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company appointed to administer the Plan (the
"Committee") shall not be deemed an interruption of employment or service.

            1.6     Failure to Exercise Option.  To the extent that following
termination of employment or service, the Option is not exercised within the
applicable periods described above, all further rights to purchase shares
pursuant to the Option shall cease and terminate.

     2.     Method of Exercise of Option.  The Option may be exercised only
by notice in writing from the Optionee to the Company of the Optionee's
binding commitment to purchase shares, specifying the number of shares the
Optionee desires to purchase under the Option and the date on which the
Optionee agrees to complete the transaction and, if required to comply with
the Securities Act of 1933, containing a representation that it is the
Optionee's intention to acquire the shares for investment and not with a view
to distribution.  On or before the date specified for completion of the
purchase, the Optionee must pay the Company the full purchase price of those
shares in cash or by check.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, no
shares shall be issued until full payment for the shares has been made,
including all amounts owed for tax withholding.  The Optionee shall,
immediately upon notification of the amount due, if any, pay to the Company
in cash or by check amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal,
state and local tax withholding requirements.  If additional withholding is
or becomes required (as a result of exercise of the Option or as a result of
disposition of shares acquired pursuant to exercise of the Option) beyond any
amount deposited before delivery of the certificates, the Optionee shall pay
such amount to the Company, in cash or by check, on demand.  If the Optionee
fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company or the Employer may withhold
that amount from other amounts payable to the Optionee, including salary,
subject to applicable law.

     3.     Nontransferability.  The Option is nonassignable and
nontransferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law,
except as provided below and except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution of the state or country of the Optionee's domicile at the time
of death, and during the Optionee's lifetime, the Option is exercisable only
by the Optionee.  The Option shall also be transferable pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  Following
any permitted transfer, the Option shall continue to be subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the transfer,
provided that, except for purposes of Section 1, the term "Optionee" shall be
deemed to refer to the transferee.  All references in Section 1 to employment
or service, termination of employment or service and total disability and
death shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Optionee.
Following any termination of employment or service or total disability or
death of the original Optionee as described in Section 1, the Option shall be
exercisable by the transferee only to the extent and for the periods
specified.

     4.     Changes in Capital Structure.  If the outstanding shares of
Common Stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other
securities of the Company or of another corporation by reason of any
reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of exchange, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock split-up, combination of shares or dividend payable
in shares, appropriate adjustment shall be made by the Committee in the
number and kind of shares subject to the Option, or the unexercised portion
thereof, so that the Optionee's proportionate interest before and after the
occurrence of the event is maintained; provided, however, that this Section 4
shall not apply with respect to Approved Transactions (as defined below).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have no obligation to
effect any adjustment that would or might result in the issuance of
fractional shares, and any fractional shares resulting from any adjustment
may be disregarded or provided for in any manner determined by the Committee.
Any such adjustments made by the Committee shall be conclusive.  In the event
of any merger, consolidation or plan of exchange affecting the Company to
which Section 5 does not apply, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
provide a 30-day period prior to such event during which the Optionee shall
have the right to exercise the Option, in whole or in part, without any
limitation on exercisability, and upon the expiration of such 30-day period,
the Option shall immediately terminate.

     5.     Special Acceleration in Certain Events.  Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, the Option shall, at any time when the
shareholders of the Company approve an Approved Transaction, immediately
become exercisable in full during the remainder of the term of the Option;
provided, however, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a
30-day period prior to the Approved Transaction during which the Optionee
shall have the right to exercise the Option, in whole or in part, without any
limitation on exercisability, and upon the expiration of such 30-day period,
the Option shall immediately terminate.  For purposes of this Section 5, the
term "Approved Transaction" means (a) any consolidation, merger, plan of
exchange or transaction involving the Company (a "Merger") in which the
Company is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which
the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or
other property, other than a Merger involving the Company in which the
holders of the Common Stock of the Company immediately prior to the Merger
have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving
corporation after the Merger or (b) any sale, lease, exchange or other
transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or
substantially all of the  assets of the Company or the adoption of any plan
or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

     6.     Conditions on Obligations.  The Company shall not be obligated to
issue shares of Class B Common Stock upon exercise of the Option if the
Company is advised by its legal counsel that such issuance would violate
applicable state or federal laws, including securities laws.  The Company
will use its best efforts to take steps required by state or federal law or
applicable regulations in connection with issuance of shares upon exercise of
the Option.

     7.     No Right to Employment or Service.  Nothing in the Plan or this
Agreement shall (a) confer upon the Optionee any right to be continued in the
employment of an Employer or interfere in any way with the Employer's right
to terminate the Optionee's employment at will at any time, for any reason,
with or without cause, or to decrease the Optionee's compensation or
benefits, or (b) confer upon the Optionee any right to be retained or
employed by the Employer or to the continuation, extension, renewal or
modification of any compensation, contract or arrangement with or by the
Employer.  The determination of whether to grant any option under the Plan is
made by the Company in its sole discretion. The grant of the Option shall not
confer upon the Optionee any right to receive any additional option or other
award under the Plan or otherwise.

     8.     Successors of Company.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of any successor of the Company but, except as
provided herein, the Option may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by
the Optionee.

     9.     Rights as a Shareholder.  The Optionee shall have no rights as a
shareholder with respect to any shares of Class B Common Stock until the date
the Optionee becomes the holder of record of those shares.  No adjustment
shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs
before the date the Optionee becomes the holder of record.

     10.     Amendments.   The Company may at any time amend this Agreement
to extend the expiration periods provided in Section 1 or to increase the
portion of the Option that is exercisable.  Otherwise, this Agreement may not
be amended without the written consent of the Optionee and the Company.

     11.     Committee Determinations.  The Optionee agrees to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations of the
Committee or other administrator of the Plan as to the provisions of the Plan
or this Agreement or any questions arising thereunder.

     12.     Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the state of Oregon.

     13.     Complete Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the Optionee and the Company, both oral and written
concerning the matters addressed herein, and all prior agreements or
representations concerning the matters addressed herein, whether written or
oral, express or implied, are terminated and of no further effect.
