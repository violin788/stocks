<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;29, 2002, we commenced a medium-term note program for the possible issuance, from time to time, of up to $500,000,000 of
medium-term notes, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-3, File No.&nbsp;333-71324 (which Registration Statement also constitutes, pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;429 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Post-Effective Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-3, File No.&nbsp;333-
71975), declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January&nbsp;24, 2002, and supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated May&nbsp;29, 2002. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On

receiving offers to purchase the medium-term notes. In addition, any agent may also purchase medium-term notes as principal pursuant to a terms agreement relating to the
applicable sale. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
medium-term notes are issuable pursuant to an Indenture dated as of December&nbsp;13, 1996, by and between us and Bank One Trust Company, National Association
(successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago) (the "Indenture"). In connection with the commencement of our medium-term note program and pursuant to the Indenture, we

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Ladies and Gentlemen: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>NIKE,&nbsp;Inc.,
an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated, Banc One Capital Markets,&nbsp;Inc., Banc of America
Securities LLC, Commerzbank Capital Markets Corp., Fleet Securities,&nbsp;Inc., HSBC Securities (USA)&nbsp;Inc., Salomon Smith Barney&nbsp;Inc., Scotia Capital (USA)&nbsp;Inc.,
Tokyo-Mitsubishi International plc and U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray&nbsp;Inc. (each, an "Agent", and collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue
(the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of December&nbsp;13, 1996, as amended or modified from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One
Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee"). As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up
to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of Notes (or its equivalent, based upon the exchange rate on the applicable trade date in such foreign or composite currencies as the Company
shall designate at the time of issuance) to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of
additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date
hereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company
directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent), in which case the applicable Agent will act as an agent of the Company in soliciting offers for
the purchase of Notes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-3 (No.&nbsp;333-71324) and
pre-effective amendment no.&nbsp;1 thereto for the registration of debt securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering
thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule&nbsp;415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been
declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company has filed such
post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to its acceptance of any offer for the purchase of Notes and each such post-effective amendment has been declared
effective by the Commission. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable) is referred to herein as the </FONT></P>

Notes), in the form first furnished to the applicable Agent(s) for use in confirming sales of Notes, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that all references to
the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934
Act"), prior to any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes but shall exclude the Statement of Eligibility of Trustee on Form&nbsp;T-1; provided, further, that if
the Company files a registration statement with the Commission pursuant to Rule&nbsp;462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule&nbsp;462(b) Registration Statement"), then, after such filing,
all references to the "Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to include the Rule&nbsp;462(b) Registration Statement. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used
before the Registration Statement became
effective and any prospectus furnished by the Company after the Registration Statement became effective and before any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes which omitted
information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to
the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). </FONT></P>

reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement,

by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the
other hand, from the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause&nbsp;(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause&nbsp;(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable
Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the applicable Agent(s) and the parties' relative

am general counsel for NIKE,&nbsp;Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and am rendering this opinion in connection with the Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution
Agreement") dated as of May&nbsp;29, 2002 between the Company and you (collectively, the "Agents") and in connection with the issuance by the Company of up to $500,000,000 (or its equivalent in one
or more foreign currencies or composite currencies) in aggregate initial public offering price of its Medium-Term Notes (the "Notes"), having such terms and provisions established in an
Officers' Certificate dated May&nbsp;29, 2002 pursuant to the indenture dated as of December&nbsp;13, 1996 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, National Association
(successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee ("Trustee"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on October&nbsp;10, 2001 (File No.&nbsp;333-71324), as amended by Amendment No.&nbsp;1 filed with
the Commission on January&nbsp;22, 2002 (collectively, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), the "Registration Statement") (which Registration
Statement also constitutes, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;429 under the Act, Post-Effective Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to Registration Statement No.&nbsp;333-71975), a prospectus dated
January&nbsp;24, 2002 (the "Base Prospectus"), a prospectus supplement dated May&nbsp;29, 2002 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the Distribution Agreement. The Base Prospectus and the Prospectus

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
such counsel, I have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. In my examination, I have assumed
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to
facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, I have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives
of the Company and others. In addition, I have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from public officials as I have deemed necessary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
am opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States and the internal laws of the State of Oregon and I express no opinion with
respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever
a statement herein is qualified as to knowledge, awareness, or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that neither I nor any other lawyers in the Company's legal
department have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as otherwise expressly indicated, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the
accuracy of any such statement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is my opinion that, as of the date hereof: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon, with corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the best of my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party
or of which any property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is the subject, required to be described in the Prospectus, which are not described as required. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of the Distribution Agreement and Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Notes, in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof, have been duly authorized for offer, sale, issuance and delivery pursuant to the Distribution
Agreement by the Company; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that I have assumed that the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes that my be validly issued will be reduced dollar for dollar for any other debt securities issued and sold under the Registration Statement after the date hereof. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company pursuant to the Distribution Agreement in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof and the performance
by the Company of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Distribution Agreement and the Interest Calculation Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;29, 2002 between the Company and Trustee will
not result in the violation by the Company of (a)&nbsp;its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or (b)&nbsp;any federal or Oregon statute, rule or regulation (other than federal or state securities
laws) known to me to be applicable to the Company or any order known to me of any court or governmental agency or body or in the breach of or a default under any material indenture, note, loan,
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other written agreement creating, evidencing or securing indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money or any material lease to which the Company is a party,
other than, with regard to (b)&nbsp;above, such violations, breaches or defaults which would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not
adversely affect the validity of the Notes. </FONT></P>

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the best of my knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any Oregon court or governmental agency or body is required for the
consummation of the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the
Distribution Agreement, except such as may be required under state securities laws in connection with the solicitation by the Agents of offers to purchase Notes from the Company and with purchases of
Notes by the Agents as principal, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which its
ownership or lease of substantial properties or the conduct of its business require such qualification, and in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a material adverse
effect upon the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is not, and upon issuance and sale of the Notes and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment
company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Incorporated Documents, when they were filed with the Commission, appeared on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that I express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial
and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Incorporated Documents. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Incorporated Documents, I have assumed that the statements
made and incorporated by reference therein are correct and complete. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;No
facts came to my attention that caused me to believe that any of the Incorporated Documents, when they were so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when the Incorporated Documents were so filed, not
misleading; it being understood, however, that I express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference
in the Incorporated Documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the best of my knowledge, there are no contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus (or required to be
filed under the Exchange Act, if upon such filing they would be incorporated by reference therein) or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described and filed as
required. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
opinions set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 above are based upon my consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to the
transactions herein contemplated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
opinion is rendered only to you and is solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose,
or furnished to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without my prior written consent; provided, however, that Sidley Austin Brown&nbsp;&amp; Wood LLP may
rely on paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this opinion in connection with the opinion it is rendering to you pursuant to Section&nbsp;5(b)(1) of the Distribution Agreement. </FONT></P>

advise you that enforcement of the Notes and the Indenture may be limited by (a)&nbsp;requirements that a claim with respect to any Notes denominated other than in United States dollars (or a
foreign currency or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on the date determined pursuant to applicable law or

Distribution Agreement; that the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the Company; that the Indenture has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the
Company; that the Trustee under the Indenture is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; that the Trustee is duly qualified to engage
in the activities contemplated by the Indenture; that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the
Trustee enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms; that the Trustee is in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as
trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations; and that the Trustee has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the

this Note shall not have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency,
any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately
11:00&nbsp;A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent)

currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments. If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any,

the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of
facsimile transmission. The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or
interest and need not file&nbsp;a separate election for each payment. Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation
must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

principal, premium, if

of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined
below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available
Market Exchange Rate. The "Market Exchange Rate" for the Specified Currency means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for
customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the "Debt Securities") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of
December&nbsp;13, 1996, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to First
National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby
made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which
the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of
Issue" (the "Notes"). All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the
face hereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following two paragraphs, will not be
redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to
time in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other
minimum Authorized Denomination), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), on written notice
given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not more than 60 nor less than 30&nbsp;days prior to the Redemption Date. The "Redemption Price" shall be the Initial
Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof as set forth below) multiplied by the unpaid
principal amount of this Note to be redeemed. The Initial Redemption Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any,
until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and
otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in
increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized
Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the "Repayment Date"). For
this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30&nbsp;days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and [the form hereon

the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable. In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions
as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will
be equal to the sum of (1)&nbsp;the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if
applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2)&nbsp;any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the
Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as
the "Discount". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be
accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant. The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that,
except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the
maturity of this Note will not be accelerated. If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this
Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular
compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may, and in certain cases shall, be accelerated in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i)&nbsp;the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii)&nbsp;certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in
each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders
of the Debt Securities at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time outstanding and
affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, on behalf of the
Holders of all such Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture. Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of a majority of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and other
Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. </FONT></P>

Company, National Association (successor in interest to First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture
and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as

terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity of

purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be

period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period), a coupon rate
equal to the initial interest rate applicable to this Note and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated. If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest
Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If the Initial Period is
longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence. </FONT></P>
