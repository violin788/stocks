Item 5.02(e)   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of
Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of
Certain Officers

     On July 26, 2007, NIKE, Inc. and Donald W. Blair, Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, agreed to terminate an employment offer letter
between Mr. Blair and us dated as of November 1, 1999 (the "Agreement").
The Agreement, which was executed in connection with Mr. Blair's
commencement of employment at NIKE, described the initial terms of Mr.
Blair's compensation, and provided in part that if Mr. Blair was terminated
by us other than for cause, we must pay to him (a) a lump sum equal to his
then-current annual base salary, (b) monthly payments of his then-current
monthly salary for twelve months, and (c) two times the amount of bonus he
would have earned for such twelve-month period.  The Agreement had been
substantially performed or superseded, except for such severance provision.
