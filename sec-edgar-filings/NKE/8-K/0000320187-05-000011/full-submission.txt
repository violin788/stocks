             NIKE, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS

           WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS INCREASE 9.6 PERCENT

Beaverton, OR (March 17, 2005) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
revenues and earnings for the Company's third quarter ended February 28,
2005.  Third quarter revenues increased 14 percent to $3.3 billion,
versus $2.9 billion for the same period last year. Third quarter net
income totaled $273.4 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to
$200.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in the prior year.

"Today's results mark another terrific quarter for Nike, Inc.," said
William D. Perez, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer.
"This was our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and
earnings per share growth.  These consistently strong results were
driven by excellent performance across geographies and brands, coupled
with favorable trends in foreign exchange rates.  In addition to
another strong quarter for our U.S. business, emerging international
markets such as China, Russia and Brazil produced significant growth.
While the core Nike Brand fueled the majority of our growth, Nike Golf,
Converse and Cole Haan were also major contributors to our positive
results."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2005 through July 2005,
totaling $5.2 billion, 9.6 percent higher than such orders reported for
the same period last year.  Approximately one point of this growth was
due to changes in currency exchange rates.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up nine percent; Europe
increased seven percent; Asia Pacific grew 14 percent; and the Americas
increased 22 percent.  In Europe, two points of the increase were due
to currency exchange rates.  Currency exchange rates contributed to the
growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas by approximately two points and
one point, respectively.*

Perez continued, "Global consumer demand for Nike brand footwear and
apparel continues to be strong, as evidenced by the growth in futures
orders.  Demand in the U.S. market remains particularly robust, as Nike
product innovation continues to drive the trend toward performance
footwear and apparel in this market."*
