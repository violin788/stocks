In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 gross margins were comparable to the

was 33.5 percent compared to 34.9 percent last year.  Fourth quarter net
income included $19.3 million, net of taxes, related to the expensing of
stock options. In addition, the prior year fourth quarter net income
included a one-time $30.8 million charge, net of taxes, related to the
Converse arbitration ruling.  Excluding these two items fourth quarter
diluted earnings per share would have increased 29 percent to $0.90 from
$0.70 last year.

For the fiscal year, gross margins were 43.9 percent compared to 44.0
percent last year; selling and administrative expenses were 30.8 percent
versus 29.9 percent last year; and the effective tax rate was 32.2 percent
compared to 35.0 percent last year.  Net income for the fiscal year included
$96.7 million, net of taxes, related to the expensing of stock options and a
$9.6 million benefit, net of taxes, for settling the Converse arbitration
ruling for less than the amount accrued in fiscal 2006. Excluding these two
items diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year would have increased 15
percent to $3.10 compared to $2.70 last year.

increase of 2 percent from May 31, 2006.  Cash and short-term investments

* The marked paragraphs contain forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially.  These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time
in reports filed by NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and
10-K. Some forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in
futures orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total
revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and "at once"
orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts,
which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a
significant portion of the business does not report futures orders.
