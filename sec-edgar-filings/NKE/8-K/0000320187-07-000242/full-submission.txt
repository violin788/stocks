outstanding equity shares of Umbro from Sports Direct International plc
("Sports Direct") in a privately negotiated transaction.  NIKE Vapor paid
Sports Direct 1.9306 British pounds sterling for each of the 29,069,977
shares, for a total purchase price of (pound sterling)56.4 million
(approximately US$112 million).  The purchase price per share is the
price offered to all shareholders in the Umbro Offer.

     Sports Direct continues to hold 10% of the outstanding equity shares
of Umbro.  Sports Direct also executed and delivered to NIKE Vapor an
irrevocable undertaking to vote those shares in favor of the Umbro Offer,
or to accept the offer in the event NIKE Vapor elects to implement the
Umbro Offer by way of a takeover offer.  The Umbro Offer is subject to
shareholder approval, a vote on which is scheduled for January 31, 2008.
