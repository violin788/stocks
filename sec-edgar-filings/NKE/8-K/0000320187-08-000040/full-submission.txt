"NIKE turned in another strong performance in fiscal year 2008. The power

In fiscal 2008, following a strategic review of the Company's affiliate
brands portfolio, the Company made a number of changes. During the year,
the Company completed the divestiture of the Starter brand and NIKE Bauer
Hockey and the acquisition of Umbro. The Starter brand was sold for $60
million in cash resulting in a gain of $29 million, which was included in
third quarter Other income (expense). NIKE Bauer Hockey was sold for $189
million in cash resulting in a gain of $32 million, which was included in
fourth quarter Other income, (expense). As part of the sale, the Company
licensed the limited use of certain Company trademarks for a period of two
years.  Accordingly, $41 million of the sales price was deferred and will
be recognized in Other income, (expense) over the license period. The
acquisition of Umbro was completed in the fourth quarter for total
consideration of (pound sterling) 290.5 million (approximately $576
million), inclusive of transaction fees.

Income Statement Review

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 gross margins were 45.8 percent
compared to 43.8 percent for the same period last year. For the fiscal
year, gross margins were 45.0 percent compared to 43.9 percent last year.

Selling and administrative expenses were 33.1 percent of fourth quarter
revenue compared to 29.0 percent for the same period last year. For the
fiscal year, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue
were 32.0 percent versus 30.8 percent last year.

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.3 percent compared to
33.5 percent for the same period last year, benefiting from a larger
proportion of earnings coming from outside the United States where the
Company benefits from lower tax rates. For the fiscal year, the effective
tax rate was 24.8 percent compared to 32.2 percent last year; reflecting a
one-time tax benefit related to utilization of past foreign losses that
contributed $0.21 per diluted share, as well as continued improvements in
the tax efficiency of the Company's global operations.

Balance Sheet Review

At the end of the fiscal year, global inventories stood at $2.4 billion,
an increase of 15 percent from May 31, 2007. Cash and short-term
investments were comparable to the end of last fiscal year at $2.8
billion.

Share Repurchase

During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased a total of 4,447,605
shares for approximately $290 million in conjunction with the Company's
four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of
Directors in June 2006. As of the end of the fiscal year, the Company has
purchased a total of 38,646,058 shares for approximately $2.1 billion

looking statements in this release concern changes in futures orders that are
not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods

order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter

1 The Company evaluates performance of individual operating segments
based on pre-tax income.  Total pre-tax income equals Income before
income taxes as shown on the Consolidated Income Statement.

2 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2008 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously
reported results of operations or shareholders' equity.

3 "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to total pre-tax
income, which includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the
operating segments for management reporting and intercompany
eliminations for specific items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
