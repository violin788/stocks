Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

The Company entered into an Employment Agreement and a Covenant Not to Compete
and Non-Disclosure Agreement with Mr. Ronald D. McCray, under which Mr. McCray
was to become Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer on August 31,
2007.

The following descriptions of Mr. McCray's Employment Agreement and Covenant
Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreements") briefly
summarize the material terms and conditions and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreements, which are filed as
Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to the current report on Form 8-K.

Under the terms of Mr. McCray's Employment Agreement, Mr. McCray will receive
an annual base salary of $650,000 and a one time sign-on bonus of $350,000.
Mr. McCray's incentive bonus target under the Company's annual Performance
Sharing Plan will be 70% of his annual salary, the payout for which can be
higher or lower depending on the Company's financial performance in relation to
performance targets set annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors.  Mr. McCray will also receive, subject to approval by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (i) a stock option to purchase
50,000 shares of the Class B Common Stock, which will vest with respect to 25%
of the shares on the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, (ii) an
initial sign-on restricted stock bonus granted as of September 17, 2007 with a
value of $800,000 based on the closing market price on that day, which will
vest with respect to one-third of the shares on the first three
anniversaries of the date of grant, and (iii) a restricted stock bonus
granted in July, 2008 with a value of $250,000 based on the closing market
price on the date of grant, which will vest 100% on the first anniversary
of the date of grant. Mr. McCray will receive an annual award under the
Company's Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") with a target payout of
$300,000, the payout for which can be higher or lower depending on the
Company's financial performance in relation to the three-year performance
targets set annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors.  The Company will also pay Mr. McCray a cash bonus as if he had
been a participant in the LTIP for the three-year performance periods of
fiscal 2006-2008 and fiscal 2007-2009, with target payouts of $300,000. If
Mr. McCray's employment is terminated by the Company without cause, or if
he terminates his employment for good reason, Mr. McCray will receive for
one year a monthly payment equal to his last monthly base salary, and a
lump sum equal to 100 percent of his target bonus under the Executive
Performance Sharing Plan.

Mr. McCray's Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement contains
a covenant not to compete that extends for one year following the
termination of his employment with the Company.  The Agreement provides
that if Mr. McCray's employment is terminated by the Company, the
Company will make monthly payments to him during the one-year
noncompetition period in an amount equal to 1/12th of his then current
annual salary.  If Mr. McCray voluntarily resigns, the Company will make
monthly payments to him during the one-year noncompetition period in an
amount equal to 1/24th of his then current annual salary.  Termination
payments under the Employment Agreement above, if paid, satisfy the
payments under the Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement, if
enforced.  The Company may waive the covenant not to compete.  If the
covenant is waived, the Company will not be required to make the payments
described above for the months as to which the waiver applies.

July 17, 2007



Mr. Ron McCray
9242 Hathaway
Dallas, TX  75220

Dear Ron:

Welcome!  We are very pleased to confirm your acceptance of Nike's offer
to employ you as its Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.  We
feel that your experience and talents are valuable to NIKE, and we are
excited that you will be joining the team. As discussed, your start date
will be August 31, 2007.

We are offering you an annualized salary of $650,000 which will be paid on
bi-weekly basis.

We are also offering you a sign-on bonus of $350,000 which will be paid
along with your first paycheck.  Bonus payments are subject to the
appropriate withholdings and deductions.

As a Nike employee, you will participate in our Performance Sharing Plan
(PSP).  PSP is a bonus program based upon a percentage of your eligible
paid fiscal year earnings (June 1 - May 31), and is distributed in August
of each year if we achieve our Pre-Tax Income goals for the year just
concluded.  The target PSP percentage for this position is 70%.  This
incentive bonus will vary based upon company performance.  If
extraordinary performance is achieved, you can earn up to 150% of your
target award.

Subject to approval by the Nike, Inc. Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors, and the terms of Nike's 1990 Stock Incentive Plan, as it may
be amended from time to time, Nike will grant you an initial "sign-on"
option to purchase 50,000 shares of Nike, Inc. Class B Common Stock with
an exercise price equal to the closing market price on the date of grant.
The option will vest 25 percent per year, and have a ten year term.  The
effective date of the grant will coincide with the first Compensation
Committee meeting following commencement of your employment, now scheduled
for September 17, 2007.

Subject to approval by the Nike, Inc. Compensation Committee and the terms
of Nike's 1990 Stock Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to
time, Nike will also grant you $800,000 worth of Nike, Inc. Class B Common
Stock, which shall be "restricted." These restricted shares will vest at
the rate of one-third per year over the three years following the date of
grant.  The effective date of this "sign-on" grant will, likewise,
coincide with the first Compensation Committee meeting following
commencement of your employment, now scheduled for September 17, 2007.

On the first company-wide general stock and stock option grant date
following commencement of your employment, Nike will grant you an option
to purchase 50,000 shares of Nike, Inc. Class B Common Stock with an
exercise price equal to the closing price on the date of grant.  The
number of shares and terms of the annual award will in the future be
subject to your individual performance, approval by the Nike, Inc.
Compensation Committee, and the terms of the Nike, Inc. 1990 Stock
Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.   The annual grant
traditionally takes place in July, so the next grant date will be in July
2008.

Also in July 2008, Nike shall grant you $250,000 worth of Nike, Inc. Class
B Common Stock, which shall be "restricted."  These restricted shares
shall be in addition to the "sign-on" restricted shares referenced above
and in this case vest at the rate of 100% per year over the one year
following the date of grant.  Our restricted stock grant practice follows
a three year cycle.  While the value of the grant of restricted shares is
subject to your individual performance, you are eligible for a full three
year grant the following year, July 2009.

You will be eligible to participate in Nike's Long Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP).  The LTIP is designed to reward you based on Nike's Revenue and
Earnings Per Share performance over a three-year period.  The plan could
pay out more or less than target depending on Nike's performance.
Applicable to the FY08 and FY09 LTIP, if extraordinary performance is
achieved, you can earn up to 150% of your target award. Applicable to the
FY10 LTIP, if extraordinary performance is achieved, you can earn up to
200% of your target award.  Plan awards are made in cash at the end of the
three-year performance period.

As a Corporate Vice President, your target award will be $300,000. Since
you are joining Nike mid-way in some Plan years, your target award would
normally be pro-rated for Fiscal Years '08 and '09.    However, you will
be paid an additional cash bonus each year beginning with the FY08 plan as
if you had been a full participant in each of the three years of the plan
(see chart below).

          3-Year Performance      Normal Target      Award Target Award after
                Period          Award if Start July    Special Make-up Bonus


FY08 LTIP  FY06, FY07, FY08         $100,000                 $300,000

FY09 LTIP  FY07, FY08, FY09         $200,000                 $300,000

FY10 LTIP  FY08, FY09, FY10         $300,000                 $300,000
                                                          (no pro-ration)

You will be eligible for corporate benefits starting the first day of the
month following 30 days of employment. Amongst the large suite of
corporate benefits offered, included is Nike's 401(K) and Profit Sharing
Plan.  Provided you enroll in the plan, Nike will match 100% of the first
5% of your before tax contributions up to the IRS dollar limit.  You are
100% vested in the 401(K) plan at all times.

In addition, Nike makes contributions to your profit sharing account.  The
amount varies each year and is based on Nike's annual financial
performance results.  You must be employed on June 1 and May 31 of the
plan year and you must complete 1,000 or more hours of service to be
eligible for a contribution.  You become vested in your Profit Sharing
Account based on years of service and are fully vested after five years.

Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP)
________________________________

You are eligible to contribute to the DCP.  This non-qualified plan offers
several investment options and provides the advantage of tax deferring a
percentage of your salary as well as eligible bonus payments.  Regardless
of your personal decision to contribute, Nike shall make an annual
contribution to your DCP account in an amount equal to profit sharing plan
contributions (see above) on eligible compensation over the IRS annual
dollar limits related to qualified benefit plans.

As a Vice President, you are defined as a "key employee" under the DCP
subject to special plan provisions.  Under these provisions, you will not
be able to receive a distribution until six months from the date of
separation from service.  This six-month delay does not apply to
distributions on account of death, disability, or unforeseeable financial
hardship or to scheduled withdrawals.  Further details on this plan will
be provided to you.

Executive Financial Services Program
____________________________________

You will be eligible to receive 50% reimbursement up to $5,000 per
calendar year for fees charged by financial service providers for time
spent giving advice and assistance in the following areas:
     - Tax Planning and Tax Return Preparation
     - Investment Planning
     - Cash Flow Planning
     - Retirement Planning
     - Estate Planning
     - Insurance Planning/Risk Management

If your employment terminates as a result of a termination for Cause or

            "Cause" means any one of the following:  (i) fraud, (ii)

job duties, which includes but is not limited to conduct which in the
judgment of Nike creates a conflict of interest or the appearance of a

connection with your performance of your job responsibilities or duties
under this Agreement that results in injury to the reputation , business,
business prospects, or business relationships of Nike, (iii)

plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof, (vi) violation of the terms of your Covenant

harassment anti discrimination policy, (viii) in carrying out your duties,

satisfactorily perform any of your material employment duties or duties
inherent in your position or title and as described above, which failure
continues, in the reasonable judgment of Nike, after written notice given
to you by Nike with the opportunity to cure such failure within 30 days.

            "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following, without your prior written consent and without full cure on 30
days notice from you to Nike requesting cure:  (i) a material breach by
Nike of a material term of this Agreement; (ii) a material reduction in
your title, duties or responsibilities below the level of such duties and
responsibilities as are assigned at the outset of your employment;
provided that: (A) any such change in connection with the termination of
your employment for Cause or due to disability, or as a result of your
death, or voluntary termination of employment by you other than for Good

only remain in effect until and including August 27, 2010.

reason, all continuing relocation benefits and reimbursements will cease

your new position.  This letter constitutes your offer with Nike and
supersedes all prior oral and written communications.  As a part of our
agreement, you acknowledge that your employment at Nike is "at will". This

relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without
notice.

hope that you will find opportunity, challenge, and satisfaction in your
association with Nike, Inc.  If you have any questions, please feel free

                      COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE
                    AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT


PARTIES:
_______

      Ronald McCray ("EMPLOYEE")
and
      NIKE, Inc., and its parent, divisions,
      subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns. ("NIKE"):


RECITALS:
________

     A.     This Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement
is executed upon the EMPLOYEE's bona fide advancement with NIKE and is
a condition of such advancement.  Employee acknowledges that this
Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is a condition of
advancement.

     B.     Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE,
EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or is in a position to
develop confidential information peculiar to NIKE's business and not
generally known to the public as defined below ("Protected
Information").  It is anticipated that EMPLOYEE will continue to be
exposed to Protected Information of greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE
advances in the company.

     C.     The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive and
disclosure of any Protected Information would result in severe damage
to NIKE and be difficult to measure.

     D.     NIKE makes use of its Protected Information throughout the
world.  Protected Information of NIKE can be used to NIKE's detriment
anywhere in the world.

AGREEMENT:
_________

In consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:

     1.     Covenant Not to Compete.
            _______________________

           (a)   Competition Restriction.  During EMPLOYEE's employment
                 _______________________
by NIKE, under the terms of any employment contract or otherwise, and
for 1 year thereafter, (the "Restriction Period"), EMPLOYEE will not
directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, or participate in the
ownership, management or control of, or be employed by, consult for, or
be connected in any manner with, any business engaged anywhere in the
world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports equipment,
sports electronics/technology and sports accessories business, or any
other business which directly competes with NIKE or any of its parent,
subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a "Competitor").  By way of
illustration only, examples of NIKE competitors include, but are not
limited to: Adidas, FILA, Reebok, Puma, Skechers, KSwiss, Garmin,
Polar, Merrell, Timberland, Champion, Oakley, DKNY, Asics, Saucony, New
Balance, Ralph Lauren/Polo Sport, B.U.M, FUBU, The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger,
Umbro, The North Face, Foot Locker, Sports Authority, Columbia
Sportswear, Under Armour, Wilson, Mizuno, Callaway Golf and Titleist.
This provision is subject to NIKE's option to waive all or any portion
of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below.

           (b)   Extension of Time.  In the event EMPLOYEE breaches
                 _________________
this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall
automatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all
subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach through private
settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals.  The
Restriction Period shall continue upon the effective date of any such
settlement judicial or other resolution.  NIKE shall not be obligated
to pay EMPLOYEE the additional compensation described in paragraph 1(d)
below during any period of time in which this Agreement is tolled due
to EMPLOYEE's breach.  In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional
compensation after any such breach, EMPLOYEE must immediately reimburse
NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a
written request by NIKE.

            (c)   Waiver of Non-Compete.  NIKE has the option, in its
                  _____________________
sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the Restriction
Period or to limit the definition of Competitor, by giving EMPLOYEE
seven (7) days prior notice of such election.  In the event all or a
portion of the Restriction Period is waived, NIKE shall not be
obligated to pay EMPLOYEE for any period of time as to which the
covenant not to compete has been waived.

            (d)   Additional Consideration.  As additional
                  ________________________
consideration for the covenant not to compete described above, should
NIKE terminate EMPLOYEE's employment and elect to enforce the non-
competition agreement, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal
to one hundred percent (100%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary
while the Restriction Period is in effect.  If EMPLOYEE voluntarily
terminates employment and NIKE elects to enforce the non-competition
agreement, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly severance payment equal to
fifty percent (50%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary while the
Restriction Period is in effect. The first payment to EMPLOYEE of
additional consideration shall follow on the next applicable pay period
after the election to enforce the non-competition agreement, payable in
accordance with NIKE's payroll practices.

name of any subsequent employer during the Restriction Period, wherever
located and regardless of whether such employer is a competitor of
NIKE.

of EMPLOYEE.  Specifically, employees shall be permitted to retain as
part of their personal portfolio copies of the employees' original
artwork and designs, provided the artwork or designs have become part
of the public domain.  In any dispute between the parties with respect
to this exclusion, the burden of proof will be on EMPLOYEE and such
proof will be by clear and convincing evidence.

            (c)   Employee's Obligations.  During the period of
                  ______________________
employment by NIKE and for a period of two (2) years thereafter,
EMPLOYEE will hold in confidence and protect all Protected Information
and will not, at any time, directly or indirectly, use any Protected
Information for any purpose outside the scope of EMPLOYEE's employment
with NIKE or disclose any Protected Information to any third person or
organization without the prior written consent of NIKE.  Specifically,
but not by way of limitation, EMPLOYEE will not ever copy, transmit,
reproduce, summarize, quote, publish or make any commercial or other
use whatsoever of any Protected Information without the prior written
consent of NIKE.  EMPLOYEE will also take reasonable security
precautions and such other actions as may be necessary to insure that
there is no use or disclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected
Information in violation of this Agreement.

     4.     Return of Protected Information.  At the request of NIKE at
            _______________________________
anytime, and in any event, upon termination of employment, EMPLOYEE
shall immediately return to NIKE all Protected Information in whatever
form, including tapes, notebooks, drawings, digital files, or other
media containing Protected Information, and all copies thereof, then in
EMPLOYEE's possession or under EMPLOYEE's control.

     5.     Unauthorized Use.  During the period of employment with
            ________________
NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE will notify NIKE immediately if EMPLOYEE
becomes aware of the unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any
Protected Information by any person employed or not employed by NIKE at
the time of such possession, use or knowledge.  EMPLOYEE will cooperate
with NIKE in the investigation of any such incident and will cooperate
with NIKE in any litigation with third parties deemed necessary by NIKE
to protect the Protected Information.  NIKE shall provide reasonable
reimbursement to EMPLOYEE for each hour so engaged and that amount
shall not be diminished by operation of any payment under Paragraph
1(d) of this Agreement.

     6.     Non-Recruitment.  During the term of this Agreement and for
            _______________
a period of one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE will not directly or
indirectly , solicit, divert or hire away (or attempt to solicit,
divert or hire away) to or for himself or any other company or business
organization, any NIKE employee, whether or not such employee is a
full-time employee or temporary employee and whether or not such
employment is pursuant to a written agreement or is at will.

     7.     Accounting of Profits.  EMPLOYEE agrees that, if EMPLOYEE
            _____________________
should violate any term of this Agreement, NIKE shall be entitled to an
accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions,
remuneration or benefits which EMPLOYEE directly or indirectly has
realized and/or may realize as a result of or in connection with any
such violation (including the return of any additional consideration
paid by NIKE pursuant to Paragraph 1(d) above).  Such remedy shall be
in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other
rights or remedies to which NIKE may be entitled at law or in equity.

     8.    General Provisions.
