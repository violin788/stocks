today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I
turn the call over to Ms. Catlett, let me remind you that participants of this
call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and
those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially.</font></div>

risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC,
including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern
future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues
for subsequent periods due to mix of features and at-once orders, exchange rate
fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly
from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

numbers.</font></div>

Pam, and good afternoon everybody. Actually before I get going I just want to
knowledge that this is Pam Catlett's 40th earnings call with Nike. And I want to
congratulate Pam, on that milestone and all the great work that she has done for
Nike over the years. So cheers to Pam.</font></div>

    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Okay,
back to the call here. It is no surprise that fiscal year '09 was a tough one
for the global economy. Looking back at the past 12 months one of the most
important challenges we faced was defining what success means for both the near
and long-term. For many companies success was defined as simply surviving. As we
have said in the past, we intend to do more than just survive. We plan to emerge
from this downturn competitively stronger.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">To do
that we focus on the things that keep us healthy and opportunistic.
Specifically, we build even stronger relationships with our consumers. We
maintain the integrity of our brands. We strengthened our operational
capability. And we deliver appropriate financial performance, while positioning
Nike for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. These are the
commitments that allowed us to deliver a remarkable performance, given the
current environment.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Q4
revenues were steady on a constant dollar basis, and we significantly
outperformed our key competitors and gained share in most major markets. In
fiscal '09 revenues are $19.2 billion. And we delivered comparable EPS growth of
10% thanks to industry-leading product, strong cost management and benefits from
our tax planning initiatives.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I am
particularly pleased by our strong working capital management, which was a key
driver in delivering over $1.2 billion of free cash flow from operations. And we
did this all while consumers and many companies adopted a conservative wait and
see attitude. But Nike has never been a wait and see company. We worked quickly
and effectively to mitigate global economic pressures through strict SG&amp;A
discipline.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Over the
past nine months we restructured the Company to move into our next phase of
growth. That included laying off over 1,750 friends and teammates around the
world. We did it for all the right reasons, to build a leaner and stronger
company, reduce costs, and better leverage our resources against our greatest
growth opportunities. I wish I could say that made it easier for everybody; it
didn't.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We
continue to do the hard work inside Nike, making the tough calls on resources,
taking action on operating expenses, and that is delivering good
results.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Still, we
are an externally focused company. There are really two big questions that we
have to address. Big question number one is, where is the consumer going to land
in this new economy and what does it mean for Nike?</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Though we
all know that the challenging economic environment has affected consumer
confidence and consumption, I believe their heightened sense of caution is
likely to continue for the foreseeable future. But that said, I believe markets
will not be driven by the frugal consumer, but by the focused
consumer.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Consumers
continue to look for what they have always valued, focusing on brands and
products that they know deliver authenticity, performance and innovation. That
is a great opportunity for Nike as it plays right into our core strengths. It is
also the reason for our strong performance and share growth over this past
year.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Is there
room for a premium product in today's economy? Absolutely. And we will continue
to deliver high-end, high-performance concepts, like the Mercurial Boot, the Air
Jordan '09, Pro Combat apparel, the Air Max +9, and the LunarGlide.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But
innovation does not stop at the $100 plus price point. We are busy creating
sharper and more compelling products up and down the price ladder, and that is
especially appropriate for the times we are in. Just because a consumer has to
choose doesn't mean they have to sacrifice. This is part of the complete offense
approach you have heard me talk about for many years. I think it is especially
relevant and strategically important right now.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We are
also being much more surgical and opportunistic in how we reach consumers with
our products and brands. The deeper we drill, the more we can grow markets and
take share. That means reaching out to consumers through their sport of choice,
where they live, by product type, by channel, by season, by price, and

multiple points of contact and relevance between Nike and our consumers, and we
are leveraging all of those interactions in innovative ways. This is also part

year, our subsidiary brands contributed $2.5 billion in revenue. Converse and
Hurley continue to outperform the market, picking up share and building brand
strength. Cole Haan and NIKE Golf continue to innovate as they manage through
the tough environment, while effectively managing inventory. With our first year
of Umbro in the books, I look for this great brand to continue gaining momentum
as we head to the World Cup in South Africa.</font></div>

more word about Converse, which continues to be a real standout performer within
the portfolio. Brand strength for Converse is at an all-time high, and that
strength is translating well in markets around the world. Moreover, I recently
reviewed the product in the pipeline for Converse, and I have to tell you it is
incredibly strong and diverse. I think it is the most commercially potent
product we have ever created.</font></div>

top that there were two big questions. The big question number two is, what is
the outlook for fiscal 2010? Nike continues to be a growth company. And while we
see glimmers of economic recovery, we still have a challenging road ahead. Some
economists are already calling the bottom and others see a more fragile
environment. Even if the worst is behind us, we are taking an approach that is
both prudent and opportunistic. Healthy and smart is the way
forward.</font></div>

expect some continued headwinds against gross margins, mostly due to currency

the larger economy there are many ways to describe the recovery underway. Some
experts suggest that a V-shaped recovery, characterized by a quick drop and
rebound, which now seems unlikely. Others predicted a more prolonged U-shaped
recovery.</font></div>

the way the business media are describing a third option, a quick drop followed

Mark. Good afternoon everyone. Okay, for Q4 and for the year the NIKE brand
delivered a solid performance in some pretty choppy waters. Here is how that
translates into the numbers.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

year the NIKE brand generated record revenue, up 4% to nearly $17 billion, with
constant dollar revenue growth in every region except EMEA, which was flat.
Footwear generated revenue of $10 billion, and apparel came in at $5 billion. We
finished the year with inventories in pretty good shape, down 3%
year-on-year.</font></div>

good, solid performance, thanks in part to the fact that we are having one of
the greatest years in sports that we have seen in some time. You know, if you
remember back this time last year, Tiger Woods won the 18 hole playoff at the
U.S. Open on a torn ACL.</font></div>

was just the beginning. We had the Beijing Olympics. We dominated the college
sports landscape here in the US. Cristiano Ronaldo won FIFA player of the year.
LeBron won MVP. And Roger Federer won his 14th major, and maybe his 15th coming
up at Wimbledon. That would break Pete Sampras' record.</font></div>

his fourth ring. And on Monday two great performances by Lucas Glover and David
Duval at the U.S. Open. It has been a phenomenal run that shows no sign of
letting up. And with sports viewership at an all-time high, it's all good for
Nike.</font></div>

not so good for Nike, or anybody else for that matter, is the current economy.
One of the most important things that we need to do in times like these is stay
healthy and be ready. We have to be organized to be opportunistic; and we are.
We are closer to the market at every turn, design, marketing, and operations. As
tough as the restructuring was, it actually accelerates every part of how we go
to market.</font></div>

category offense is delivering new insights every day. And that continues to
feed the product creation process. When you look at Flywire technology, or the
Hyperdunk, or the new Nike Trainer 1, these are all direct results of our
connections to consumers. It is how we bring new ideas to market and make
existing products that much better.</font></div>

year our key performance in lifestyle categories have performed well around the
world. Global running and Nike sportswear both delivered high single-digit
growth. Basketball experienced double-digit growth on the strength of the Jordan
brand, which had a very strong year.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

sports, our newest key category, had significant double-digit growth. Men's
training was down slightly, but had some solid product concepts in the pipeline
that we will see this next year. And women's training had its biggest quarter
ever in Q4, and we are focused on building that momentum.</font></div>

in football it was flat against the Euro Champ of a year ago. And continues to

balance we are pretty encouraged by this performance, but we are not satisfied.
As Mark said, we are innovating up and down the price spectrum. And there is an
appetite for premium products. The number one selling shoe on NIKE.com is the
Air Max + at $160. I think it proves that when we do innovate, even in this
environment, consumers do respond.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

will continue to push the edge on innovation. That is something we will always
do. We are looking at new material concepts and upward constructions, new
digital capabilities to expand what we started with Nike+, and some very cool
things in the space around customization. There is lots to look forward to in
footwear.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

apparel side of the business we are seeing a deeper impact from the
macroeconomic conditions. That said, performance apparel like Pro Combat
continues to deliver solid results. And over the last year we have been
aggressive about translating our performance values into the lifestyle
space.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

and innovative product resonates with consumers, even in tough economic times.
When you look at the Victory Jacket, for example, you see how successful it can
be when we get it right. It is premium, it is performance-based design, and we
can leverage that across multiple categories. That is where we are headed in
apparel.</font></div>

with product creation comes marketplace management. And we look at that through
two lenses, geographical focus and the consumer experience. A big part of the
restructuring will allow us to focus more completely on key markets,
specifically the US, China, Japan and the UK. They represent over 60% of our
global business and will play leading roles as we emerge from the current set of
economic conditions.</font></div>

and Western Europe are going to continue to be challenging in fiscal 2010, but
we do see opportunity to gain more share going forward. In China we are
anniversaring some great numbers post-Beijing. That said, the appetite for Nike
products and athletes continues to grow. The brand is known, and more
importantly, understood among the 500 million Chinese consumers under the age of
25. That is 1 billion feet we are going after just as fast as we can, with Kobe,
LeBron and Chris Paul all planning visits back to China this
summer.</font></div>

looking for China and the emerging markets to be the first out of the gate in
the recovery period. And we are staying focused on a strong brand and a healthy
marketplace.</font></div>

the consumer experience, we remain committed to becoming a better retailer and a
better wholesaler. It is also true that the algorithm at the point-of-sale is
changing. We have seen some established retailers slip off the map this year, so
we continued to take a measured approach to retail development.</font></div>

is on two things, bringing our category offense to life at retail, and enabling
relationships and transactions online. You know, consumers in 26 countries can
now customize Nike products through NIKEiD. This kind of personal and relevant
experience will also impact how we leverage our brand and products in
store.</font></div>

is clear that we are not taking our eyes off the horizon. It will help us
leverage the recovery when it does come, and it will. But we know we also have
to be aggressive in the short term. We are leveraging every line plan, every
product and every sales call to grab share and to grow our base. Everybody took
a hit in the economy, but we stand with our brands and our inventories in very
good shape.</font></div>

not being driven into heavy discounting. We don't need to throw any Hail Mary
passes, but we won't sit on our lead either. In short, stay close to the
consumer, create innovative product, and drive premium experiences into the
global marketplace. That is what our growth strategy is. It is pretty simple
really. Our job is to do that better than anyone else, and we are.</font></div>

Excluding FX, fourth-quarter revenues were in-line with last year. On a reported

orders for NIKE brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June

earnings per share for the quarter declined 29% to $0.70, including $195 million

Our currency hedging program also generated net benefits over the first three

intensified.</font></div>

product input costs began to flow into our P&amp;L in Q2, while currency turned
from a gross margin tailwind to a modest headwind in the fourth quarter. In the
second-half of the year we also took steps to aggressively reduce inventories,

still had over $5 of cash on the balance sheet per each Nike share. As always,

This is Charlie. I think when you think about it overall the US has always been
a little bit more of -- I'll use the term tightly wound marketplace. We have a
little bit more price elasticity in some of the international markets, and I
think you saw some of that coming through on a management basis as you saw the
results for Q4.</font></div>

as we go forward we still believe that the US offers us a market that we can
grow in. We're going to continue to focus on the US as a growth market, as well
as the international markets and the emerging markets, specifically in the short
term. As you think about over the next 12 to 18 months, China and some of the
emerging markets, South America continues to perform well, where we are still
building out some of our business infrastructure.</font></div>

that is where you are -- that explains some of that. Western Europe will
continue to be one of the most challenging markets. Both economically and from a

other question I had, I think for you Don, is on the gross margin expectation of
being down around 100 basis points. How much of that -- is that all FX or can
you walk through how much of that is related to expected -- I don't know if it
would be called promotional activity or further inventory clearance or input

The ASPs in the futures for US footwear is still going up. With respect to the
gross margin, the majority of that year-on-year decline is FX driven. We do
expect to see some benefit from lower oil prices, and a little bit of easing
with some of the input costs, as well as some of our product cost initiatives.
There are going to be, we think, some headwinds, but not to the degree that we
saw in fiscal '09. But the major driver of the year-on-year erosion is
FX.</font></div>

to add to it. There's a big question around consumer appetite for premium
product. And I think if you look at our performance over the last year, and even
through our futures period going into fiscal '10, we don't see that appetite
diminishing. If anything, we have seen steady increases on the premium side,
particularly over the $120 price point.</font></div>

Actually, you have mentioned exactly the way you should be looking at it in a
sense that we have talked about this in prior calls, about repositioning the
brand and the product line from a distribution standpoint. I think you are
seeing some of the results of that in the numbers, coupled with the fact that
apparel was a harder hit sector than the footwear business was. And we have seen
that not only across our business, but I think across that entire sector. You
are seeing the apparel folks probably dealing with little bit bigger impact
under these current economic conditions.</font></div>

think the other thing that you need to watch as far as the future and what we
are doing, is that premium position product how well it is performing. And I
think we will continue to talk about that in the upcoming calls in the upcoming
quarters.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

to be clear, we are staying focused on performance product. We believe that is
the sharp point. And we are very pleased, and I am very excited and I am really
looking forward to this fall and into holiday as we really focus on performance
apparel here in the US. We've got some great things in the works. Pro Combat is
something we have talked about and alluded to a little bit and we are going to
bring that to the forefront.</font></div>

you're going to see us take and leverage the lifestyle -- the key lifestyle
silhouettes against all of the categories in a much more efficient and focused
way as we go into spring and all the way into World Cup. So those are the things
that I would ask you to watch for, and those are the things we will be talking
about in the coming months.</font></div>

Thanks, Charlie. I appreciate that. Just on when -- Don, when you talk about the
demand creation spending being flat this year, and then you talk about the
corporate overhead piece being down, I think, low to mid single digits for the
year, I assume that is on a reported basis, not in constant
currency.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I guess
the second piece to this, how much, when you look at the operating overhead
piece in terms of the reduction, is related at all to the reduction in the
overall staffing being down 5% in terms of the overall employment at Nike? How
much of that is just related to some of the nearer-term cost efficiencies in the
business, and how much of that is just the variability in the
business?</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> First
of all, what I am talking about is dollar equivalent. Obviously, that depends on
the reported currencies being broadly consistent. Most of the currency
reductions happened sort of beginning of '09. So we are talking about dollars,
and I was referring to real dollars, but that is assuming a relatively stable
currency environment. So that is your first question.</font></div>

respect to the driver, certainly the restructuring of the organization was a key
driver. There is a number of cost areas that we are working in, including
procurement and just making sure that we are very focused on everything we
spend. So this is not just about the organization, but we do believe that a lot
of this is structural. That we were very focused on the long term here and
setting ourselves up for the future, not short-term economies that go away
later.</font></div>

This is Charlie. We're pretty comfortable right now. I think one of the things
that we have alluded to in the past has been a buildup in apparel. And the
apparel numbers have come down quite a bit over the last couple of
months.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So I
think from an overall standpoint, Western Europe, United States being the two
biggest ones, we feel very good about where we are at. I said that in my
compared comments as well. Our ability to manage our brand in the marketplace is
one of our core competencies. And I think in times like this we have gone to it
and relied heavily on it. I feel really good about our inventory levels out at
retail pretty much around the world.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Sam Poser&gt;:</font> I have
got two real quick questions. When do you think -- as you see right now, when do
you see the FX headwind unwinding? Just to confirm, I think the question was
just asked, the SG&amp;A spend in 2010, you are saying is going to be flat in
dollars, based on currency staying where it is?</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font> Yes.
The currency guard rails we give people, and this is approximate, is that the
lag is anywhere from 9 to 18 months. 12 months is a reasonable approximation
from when you would expect to see spot rates start to flow through the
P&amp;L.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So if you
look at what happened with say the euro as one of the benchmark currencies, I
think we were above $1.50 in our first quarter fiscal '09 and we finished the
year at about 1.30. We are going to expect to see that reflection over a 9 to 18
month period, and 12 months is a reasonable approximation.</font></div>

just had two quick follow-ups. First, on the apparel business can you give us
any sense of how much of the decline that you are seeing right now relates to
the repositioning out of some of the value distribution? And when do you
anniversary that change and maybe see a less pressure on the
category?</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> I
think Don referenced that earlier in the sense that we think about 50% of the
decline right now is attributed to some of the re-profiling and repositioning of
year-on-year business.</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We would
continue to expect to see some of that, certainly through the next six months.
And then I think as we get into spring we will start to anniversary some of the
- -- some of that repositioning. But what consequence the economic conditions
have, we are not calling that shot right now.</font></div>

Understood. In terms of the current -- the inventory number, just any kind of
sense of the impact of currency on the inventory on the balance
sheet?</font></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
    <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> On a
constant currency basis inventory was up about 2% in constant dollars. But one
of the things we have learned is with the currency volatility that is not a
great barometer. Probably a better barometer is units of inventory. And for the
NIKE brand units were down 10% at the balance sheet date.</font></div>
