                WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS INCREASE 9.7 PERCENT

   diluted share in the prior year quarter

Beaverton, OR (December 18, 2003) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today
reported revenues and earnings for the Company's second quarter ended
November 30, 2003.  Second quarter revenues increased 13 percent to
$2.8 billion, versus $2.5 billion for the same period last year. Second
quarter net income totaled $179.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share,
compared to $152.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the prior
year.

"It was a great quarter," Philip H. Knight, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer said. "These positive results span most of Nike's
portfolio of businesses and categories. They reflect our management's
ability to lead in innovative product, communication, and operational
performance."*

Knight added, "We are optimistic the momentum we are seeing in the
business, coupled with the improving health of the footwear and apparel
industry, is setting the stage for continued profitable growth through
the remainder of fiscal 2004."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2003 through April 2004,
totaling $4.4 billion, 9.7 percent higher than such orders reported for
the same period last year.  Approximately four points of this growth
were due to changes in currency exchange rates.

By region, futures orders for the USA were up one percent; Europe
increased 16 percent; Asia Pacific grew 18 percent; and the Americas
increased 11 percent.  In Europe, eight points of the increase were due
to changes in currency exchange rates.   Currency exchange rate
movements contributed approximately four points and seven points,
respectively, to futures growth in the Asia Pacific and Americas
regions.

Knight continued, "The 9.7 percent increase in our worldwide futures
orders is the result of Nike's strong brand and product momentum around
the globe. We are particularly pleased by the continued improvement in
our USA region, which posted the first futures increase in six
quarters.  This rebound in the USA complements continued strong
performance in our international regions, which delivered 16 percent
futures orders growth for the period."*
