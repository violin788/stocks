                NIKE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS
                    PER SHARE UP 23 PERCENT;
          WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS INCREASE 9.9 PERCENT

Highlights:

- -     First quarter earnings per diluted share increased 23 percent to
      $1.21 versus $0.98 per diluted share a year ago
- -     Revenues for the quarter increased 18 percent to $3.6 billion

- -     Worldwide futures orders increased 9.9 percent

Beaverton, OR (September 20, 2004) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today
reported revenues and earnings for the Company's first quarter ended
August 31, 2004.  First quarter revenues increased 18 percent to $3.6
billion, versus $3.0 billion for the same period last year. First quarter
net income totaled $326.8 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared
to $261.2 million, or $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year.

"We're off to a great start," said Philip H. Knight, Chairman and CEO.
"Our first quarter revenues reached record levels driven by strong
results around the world and across all our brands.  These results
reflect both the strength of our brands and our ability to execute across
our portfolio of businesses."*

Knight added, "Nike's consistent performance has been the result of the
quality of our management team and our commitment to delivering value to
shareholders over the long-term."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2004 through January 2005,
totaling $4.3 billion, 9.9 percent higher than such orders reported for
the same period last year.  Approximately 0.7 percent of this growth was
due to changes in currency exchange rates.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up 11 percent; Europe
increased six percent; Asia Pacific grew 17 percent; and the Americas
increased six percent.  In Europe, three points of the increase were due
to currency exchange rates.  Currency exchange reduced the growth in Asia
Pacific and the Americas by approximately 0.5 points and five points,
respectively.*

Knight continued, "The strong growth in futures is further evidence of
the strength of our brand and product lines around the world.  Growing
consumer demand for Nike products was particularly evident in our U.S.
region, where our futures growth reached the highest level in more than
seven years."*
