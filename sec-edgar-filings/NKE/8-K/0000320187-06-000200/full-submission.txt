             Revenue up 10 percent; worldwide futures orders up 7 percent

               Improved tax rate contributes $0.13 to earnings per share

BEAVERTON, Ore. (December 20, 2006) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2006. For the

diluted share to results for the quarter.

Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The
Nike brand and our Nike Inc. portfolio continued to be strong worldwide,
driving double-digit top line growth for the quarter. Nike+, Lebron IV, Nike
Pro Revolution, Converse's Wade 1.3 and Cole Haan's Dress Air for women were
some of the product introductions creating consumer excitement and
marketplace energy. At the same time, we delivered strong earnings growth
and a significant 19 percent increase in our dividend for shareholders. Our
brands are strong, the company is growing revenues and profits, and we are
delivering on our commitment to lead the industry with sharper focus,
greater competitiveness and deeper influence through ongoing product
innovation and consumer connections."*

apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2006 through April 2007,

* The marked paragraphs contain forward-looking statements that involve

These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed
by NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K. Some
forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in futures orders
that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent
periods due to the mix of futures and "at once" orders, exchange rate
fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a significant
portion of the business does not report futures orders.
