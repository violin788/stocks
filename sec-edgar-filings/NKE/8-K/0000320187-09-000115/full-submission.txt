Welcome to NIKE's fiscal 2010 first quarter conference call. For those who need to reference today's press release, you'll find
it at www.nikebiz.com.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Leading today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Catlett, let me remind you that participants of this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s business, including equipment, most of NIKE Retail, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, and Umbro, are not included in these futures numbers.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations are found at NIKE's Web site. This call might also include discussion of non-public financial and statistical information, which is also publicly available on that site -- www.nikebiz.com.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Catlett, Vice President, Investor Relations.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Pamela Catlett</font>: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2010 first quarter results.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Before we begin our prepared comments, I would like to take a minute to remind everyone that, in conjunction with today's earnings announcement, we have changed how we report our results for the NIKE Brand.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">There are two main changes -- first, consistent with the corporate restructuring we completed earlier this year, we established new reporting for NIKE Brand operating segments, including six geographies -- North America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Emerging Markets.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">This represents a change from our previously reported structure of four regions, which included the US, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. Consistent with our previous practice, we will continue to report revenues for each of our NIKE Brand Product Types -- Footwear, Apparel and Equipment. Other Business operating
segment results represent the results of Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, Umbro and NIKE Golf.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Second, we have changed our primary profitability measure from Pre-tax Income, or PTI, to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, or EBIT, which is the primary measure used by our management team and Board to make decisions about resource allocation and to evaluate the performance of individual operating segments.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Yesterday, we filed an 8-K to provide you with reclassified historical Revenue and EBIT segment information on a quarterly basis for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. You can find that filing on the SEC's Web site and at nikebiz.com.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It is important to note that these reclassifications have no impact on NIKE, Inc.'s previously reported financial statements. We believe these reporting changes will provide you even greater transparency into our business results.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">When discussing the financial results for NIKE Brand geography, we may provide performance highlights from our seven key Categories and/or our owned retail operations when this information is necessary to understand the key business trends driving the business results in that segment. However, since these dimensions of our business do not
represent reportable operating segments, we do not intend to provide full financial results for them.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now, on to the call -- joining us today will be NIKE, Inc. CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will take your questions.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Mark Parker:</font> Thanks, Pam, and good afternoon, everyone.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Last December, as the impact of the economic downturn settled in, we said NIKE had the right mix of competitive advantages to manage through the tough times ahead. We talked about the unique strength of our brands, our business and our balance sheet. We told you that we would leverage those strengths to create even greater competitive separation,
and Q1 shows that we're doing just that.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">While consumers remain cautious, NIKE continues to connect through innovative products and compelling experiences in the marketplace. We feel very good about our relationships with consumers around the world, and we continue to gain share in key markets and categories.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That said, our strategy is not just about gaining share this quarter or next quarter; we're focused on growing the marketplace over the long-term, and we target our resources with that in mind.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We do that by drilling down in those key businesses that offer the most growth potential. That's why the NIKE Brand is aligned against seven key categories. That's why we're talking today about six new geographies to take us closer to the consumer and quicker to market. We're organized to bring a multi-category focus to multiple markets around
the world, integrating the resources of multiple brands in our portfolio.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The closer and quicker and more integrated we get, the more powerful that complete offense becomes. It's not enough to be really good in one price point or one channel. NIKE takes a broader, more ambitious view.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Basketball is a great example. A complete offense means attacking the business with three key brands -- NIKE, Jordan and Converse. This gives every hoops consumer an entry point into NIKE, Inc. It means offering truly innovative product, footwear and apparel, at every price point. And it means making sure the consumer has a premium experience
in our partner stores, our NIKE-owned stores, and online -- wherever they intersect our basketball business.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Only NIKE can connect on that many levels. That's the power of our complete offense.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I also said last time that NIKE is not a wait-and-see company, but we are a prudent company. We continued to drive savings and efficiency into the business and build off the benefits of our reorganization last quarter. Today, we are leaner, hungrier, and more entrepreneurial than ever before.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On the capital side, we have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, and it continues to be a significant competitive advantage that allows us to pursue appropriate growth opportunities.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we continue to optimize our mix of strength, balance and flexibility. That's what defines our portfolio of brands, and keeps us opportunistic in today's economy.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On the NIKE Brand side of things, we're throwing a lot of new information at you today in terms of how we report our results. Charlie's going to take you through that in just a minute, but I want to highlight two things real quickly -- product innovation and retail.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Product innovation has never been more important. I've made it a personal mission to further accelerate our innovation agenda. It's already the most ambitious and effective in the industry, but there's more we can do. That's true in how we drive innovation season to season, and it's true on how we get after quick-strike opportunities. We're
very surgical and aggressive in attacking product insights and moments in sports. That's where we discover or that's what we create.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Customization is a great example -- we've developed new experiences that allow consumers to personalize products in real-time and take it with them. There are a lot of similar ideas that live off the grid here, and I like that; it shows how hungry and opportunistic we are.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On the retail front, NIKE continues to be the go-to brand with our retail partners, and we continue to drive profitable growth with mono-branded partner stores around the world. And we're really starting to see some solid performance in our owned direct-to-consumer business, which saw record revenue in Q1.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Part of that came from factory stores, which enables us to keep the market clean and maintain the strength of our brands; some came from NIKE in-line stores, which provide access to our best products and unrivalled consumer experiences; and some came from digital commerce, which posted 19% growth for the quarter and outgrew the online industry
by a wide margin. It's a good example of the complete offense I talk about so much.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Elsewhere in the portfolio, Converse grew revenue by 10%, and delivered its most profitable first quarter ever, up 13% over last year.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Hurley delivered its 2nd biggest revenue quarter ever. Along with NIKE and Converse, Hurley gained share in the Action Sports industry. In fact, Hurley continued to grow at double-digit rate with market share gains, while the rest of the industry declined.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Umbro continues its turnaround under new leadership and an ambitious innovation agenda that kicked off with the new English National Team kit. Lots of opportunities to increase the visibility of that Brand. And when you look at Umbro and NIKE Football working together, you can see how we -- as the world's largest football company --- will
leverage the power of a complete offense to separate NIKE, Inc. around the world.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Cole Haan and NIKE Golf both operate in sectors hit especially hard by the economy. But inventories are clean and we have lots of innovation in the product pipeline.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On balance, Q1 shows a lot more than how we performed over the last three months; it shows that NIKE is poised to benefit first and most as we move through the current economy. It's not enough to simply survive -- we're more confident and competitive than that; we're focused on creating separation and momentum that allows us to extend our
leadership now and in the future.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So what does Q1 tell us about the NIKE Brand? Well, first and foremost, that we're stable and we're staying healthy. It tells us that our inventory levels are lean and well-managed, and that we have a strong innovation agenda. There's a lot of energy around sports, and it continues with the Fall season. We're in good position to invest in
growth opportunities, both short and long-term.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're performing better than ever around the things we control -- but consumers remain cautious; so do retailers. We're seeing that play out across our categories and geographies. And yes, we're gaining share. It's a good win in these conditions, but our job isn't just to gain share. Our job is to grow the market. So we're going hard at what
Mark calls our complete offense, in product, marketing and distribution.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So, what does success look like in this environment? Well, for NIKE, success is all about continuing to drive Brand heat, delivering innovative product, tell compelling stories, and finally, managing a healthy marketplace. And it's all driven by our connection to the consumer.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're elevating that consumer experience and establishing NIKE as the most compelling Brand in the marketplace. We're not looking outside for the bottom or the turn. We're combining our Brand and consumer connectivity with running tight inventories, working our gross margins, and building innovative product and capabilities. That's how we're
building consumer confidence and accelerating our separation going forward.</font></div>

You're not going to hear acronyms like EMEA and CEMEA any more. Now we're organized into six key geographies. The change is driven by the opportunities we see for growth.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That said, I think you'll see a more granular look at the impact of the global economic downturn reflected in each of these geographies. I also believe that the Q1 performance does not reflect the potential of these markets going forward, but allows us to be more focused.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Let's take a quick look at each of these new geographies and the categories that are driving the business.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First of all, North America -- two big stories here; the first -- Basketball. The Lebron and Kobe footwear franchises continue to lead NIKE Basketball, and the Jordan Brand continues to post some impressive results. Our combined Basketball business delivered high-single digit revenue gains over last year. That's pretty good, given the fact
we were up double-digits for this period last year.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The other big story -- Action Sports; a small category that's growing bigger every day. We have a three-Brand strategy that combines NIKE, Converse and Hurley, and it's proving to be a very powerful concept with consumers. Action Sports posted the biggest category percentage gain in Q1, up strong double-digits.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We continue to make gains on the performance side of Apparel. We recently launched a Pro Combat package as part of our football training attack. It's a great way to build on the momentum of NIKE Pro, a business where we've gained significant share over the last two years, and have had an even stronger momentum in the last three quarters.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Okay, let's move on to Western Europe -- and that means Football. And while overall, the category was down in revenue, we continue to gain footwear share in key markets with our Black Pack footwear, including two franchise boots -- the Tiempo Legend and the Mercurial SuperFly.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On the Apparel side, we launched the new club kits for ManU, FCB and Corinthians. So, lots of innovation across the product matrix in Football. Running and Sportswear were down, while Action Sports and Basketball turned in some strong revenue increases in this geography. And Women's Training also delivered solid results, driven by Apparel.
Overall, our Brand is strong, our product is performing, but the consumer continues to be very cautious.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Central and Eastern Europe -- this is our most challenging geography of all. We saw some exciting growth in this zone up until about a year ago, but the current economic conditions aren't allowing consumers to keep up with their appetite for the NIKE Brand.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In the short-term, we're focusing on two things -- protecting our Brand and building relationships with the consumer. The category story here is also Football. This geography is home to South Africa, which is trending upward as we move into the World Cup time frame.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're bringing a lot of product innovation to South Africa, but the World Cup is more than just a sporting event -- it's a social and cultural event, as well. And, as the world's biggest football company, I think we're well-prepared to leverage those aspects better than anyone else.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Greater China -- well, revenue was down, but we separated ourselves from our competition and we remained the #1 Brand. Basketball continues to drive excitement in this market. We took Lebron, Kobe and Chris Paul to China this summer and blew through their product.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Running is also on the move with the new LunarGlide+ selling through very well. China was one of the biggest participants in the Human Race last year, and we expect them to repeat next month with the second Human Race on October 24. So, we remain confident in China and committed to our post-Olympic strategy.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Next up, Japan. Very tough economically. Consumers continue to be very cautious, but they're willing to spend on things they believe in. We're seeing that in the Running category, where we continue to gain share against the category leader in their home country. And Apparel is getting a substantial boost through NIKE Pro. Still, like Central
and Eastern Europe, Japan is a very tough marketplace right now, and we have to be patient in both of these geographies.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And, finally the Emerging Markets, which include South America, Central America, including Mexico, the Pacific Countries, and Korea. Very solid performance here. On a constant dollar basis, Running, Basketball and Jordan are up. Women's Training is up; Sportswear and Action Sports are up. Footwear and Apparel are both up. We're seeing continued
growth throughout the region in spite of the global economic conditions. I feel pretty good about our team and our performance in the Emerging Markets.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So, I think we're off to a good start, given some very tough conditions. It's going to be a year of many challenges. That's good for the NIKE Brand. As Tiger Woods likes to say, The tougher the course, the better! It tends to separate the competition.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We said we would focus on driving sustainable, profitable revenue growth, managing inventory across the entire supply chain to match consumer demand. While we expected revenues below last year's record numbers, we're gaining share around the world and seeing improving sales trends in some markets.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We said we would continue to focus on improving gross margins by leveraging the factors we control -- such as product cost, supply chain management, and pricing -- and balancing the broader macroeconomic factors, such as capacity, currency and input costs. During the first quarter, we executed our factory consolidation strategy with no supply
disruptions and minimal cost. Overall gross margins are better than we expected, and inventories are down 7%.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Finally, we said we would continue to focus on driving the highest return from our investments in SG&amp;A, keeping overall spending at or below prior year levels. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, SG&amp;A fell 17%. As a result, EPS for the quarter was above the prior year and we generated over $600 million of Free Cash Flow from Operations.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Revenue for the quarter declined 12% to $4.8 billion; on a currency neutral basis, revenues for both NIKE, Inc. and the NIKE Brand were 7% lower than last year. As you recall, we reported 17% revenue growth in last year's first quarter, as we drove deeper consumer connections with our consumers around the European Championships and the Beijing
Olympics.</font></div>

Revenues for our Other Businesses -- including Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, NIKE Golf and Umbro -- fell 5% for the quarter, declining 3% on a currency neutral basis.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Gross margin for the quarter declined 100 basis points to 46.2%. The decline was driven largely by unfavorable exchange rates and higher discounts, as we worked to maintain clean inventories on our books and in the marketplace. In-line gross pricing margins were essentially flat.</font></div>

Excluding currency, Demand Creation was 28% below prior year spending, which was boosted by the Olympics and European Championships. Operating overhead dropped 1%, as a 4% reduction in wholesale overhead was largely offset by a 9% increase
in retail overhead, driven by new stores in fiscal '09 and fiscal '10.</font></div>

We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, combined with the foreign currency gains included in other income, increased our year-over-year pretax income by about $28 million for the quarter.</font></div>

I think -- China is a little bit of a microcosm of what Mark just talked about.

I guess, first, just looking at currency -- and I recall last time, you guys spoke about the gross margin impact, primarily due to what was going on from a currency perspective. Just given where the US dollar has trended now, and
relative to the euro and the pound and the yen, what impact is that having, when you look at your gross margin trend?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And maybe just -- I know you talked about seeing it down no less than 50 bps for the year, but to what degree does the fluctuation in currency that we're seeing right now play into it? Just kind of what your thoughts are in terms of how you're looking at currency on the gross margin.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Well, I think that we certainly are seeing a little bit more benign environment on currency now than what we had potentially expected earlier. And that is one of the drivers of the improvement in gross margin. There are others. As I mentioned in
the prepared remarks, we've made great progress in our supply chain in terms of product cost and managing through the factory consolidation.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But certainly, I think we're in better shape from an FX standpoint in the sense that the dollar has weakened a bit.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">One thing I do want to make sure I remind people is we certainly do a pretty thorough job of hedging the major currencies. A lot of the action in the gross margin space over the last 12 months has been in the smaller currencies. And those are still pretty volatile. But I think actually currency is definitely looking up, in terms of where the
trend lines are going.</font></div>

And, I guess, Charlie, for you, just -- in one category, you didn't talk about too much. And Footwear was on the Running side of the business -- whether the Shock business, et cetera. And I was wondering if maybe you could
just talk a little bit about what's going with Running. I think you mentioned -- you didn't mention too much in the US, but I think in Europe, you mentioned it was down.</font></div>

I would say that one of the bigger opportunities right now is in our core Running business. And we're seeing a little bit of erosion
there from where we've been, but I think we've got some of the products coming down the pipe that's going to deal with some of that.</font></div>

There are some timing shifts at the back end of the window. So when we look at it by season -- Fall, Holiday, Spring -- that's where we see the sequential
improvement. If you look at the numbers we've reported today it's actually pretty balanced between the two. Is that clear?</font></div>

last year, was the backlog number in the first quarter of '09. This looks more like minus $9 billion. Is there something that has to do with the change of the reporting structure that is affecting that?</font></div>

Thanks. One question I wanted to ask is in the US, we kind of saw, looking at some of the retailers out there -- and I think we saw it a little bit in your numbers this quarter as well -- the Footwear side of the business in the US
seems to have slowed. It kind of got off to a nice start; a lot of people were talking about strong Basketball; strong demand for technical product; but you saw some of the retailers report a much lower comp in the second quarter.</font></div>

We always perform a little bit better in these types of situations because people tend to migrate toward us just because of confidence and/or comfort.</font></div>

And then just one follow-up question on China, from what Bob had asked before. Are you seeing any difference in terms of how the local brands are operating over there? I know ANTA took over the Olympic sponsorship, team sponsorship, for China.
I think maybe they're having a little bit more success in some of the smaller tier markets outside of the major cities. Are you guys seeing any change in terms of how the Chinese companies are being able to connect with consumers?</font></div>

That being said, they're very, very focused on the China marketplace, and their willingness or ability to transcend
that marketplace is yet to materialize.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So, I think locally, they've performed pretty well for smaller companies in a local market. We're seeing some market share changes and shifts going on beneath us. Our share continues to widen with our nearest competitor, but we're seeing some trade-offs with both the international players and the local players down below.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our strategy has always contemplated that we were going to go into the lower tier cities.

the Fall Holiday, related to inventory planning versus the recent sales results.</font></div>

I think it's -- people feel good about maybe the last couple of weeks, but I don't
think it's a strong enough trend line to see -- we have not seen any reaction on a longer-term basis. But -- and people are still going to be relatively cautious going through that Holiday period.</font></div>

I think you commented on your last call that the orders you had on your books at the time -- you said that, as you just repeated, that they get better toward the Spring. And I'm wondering if you can
comment maybe on the ASP trends as we look front-end versus backend, particularly in the US?</font></div>

and Europe is a little bit down. So the bottom line is, most of the world, we're actually seeing ASPs move upward, with the exception of Europe.</font></div>

operational results.</font></div>

completely lined up with our shareholders. And I don't see that there's going to be any loss of focus on capital returns.</font></div>

One more question, Don. Just on FX overall -- so without getting up in a quarter here or there, I mean, we've seen a really, really long time period where this industry has been built on a strong dollar, offshored
model -- outsourced model. And now we're at a point where the world's reserve currency is very slowly but surely no longer becoming to world's reserve currency. Yet China holding one-third of the world's -- one-third of our debt and then their debt. I read of more and more of that every day.</font></div>

we look at our supply chain, we are definitely moving down the track toward a much more multi-currency approach to it.</font></div>

over the past 30 years.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So I can tell you, maybe have you rest-assured that the focus on product innovation did not diminish one bit through the restructuring efforts that we had going on in the Company during that period of time earlier this year.

in our success -- again, not just here in the US but around the world.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">That said, I think the foundation for the Converse Brand in China is very strong from a Brand standpoint.

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So -- and then as you look at Europe and what we call the emerging markets, again, lots of upside opportunity there. Shared gains seen in most markets around the world. Converse, as you know, is at a slightly lower average price point as a Brand. We think there's an appetite for that in the portfolio; certainly, within the market from a consumer
standpoint, so that's going to help as well.</font></div>

that served us very well in terms of managing inventory on our books and in the marketplace.</font></div>

countries where the event isn't happening tend to come closer to the actual event?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So -- but we feel very good about both our position with the teams that we sponsor, going into South Africa, as well as the new product innovations that we'll be releasing during that time period. So, again, I think World Cup will be a very big event upcoming for next summer. I think it's -- it may not hit the crescendo that Beijing hit in
China, but it will certainly be not only a commercial event, but a very big cultural and social event as well.</font></div>
