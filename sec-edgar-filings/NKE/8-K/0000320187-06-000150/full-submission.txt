             NIKE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.47


                       Worldwide futures orders up 6 percent


BEAVERTON, Ore. (September 21, 2006) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
financial results for the first quarter, ended August 31, 2006. Revenue grew
9 percent to $4.2 billion, compared to $3.9 billion for the same period last
year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue growth by 2
percentage points for the quarter. First quarter net income declined 13
percent to $377.2 million, compared to $432.3 million in the prior year and
diluted earnings per share declined 9 percent to $1.47, versus $1.61 last
year. Results for the first quarter included a $40.8 million expense, net of
taxes, related to the expensing of stock options, which reduced diluted
earnings per share by $0.16. Excluding stock option expense first quarter
net income declined 3 percent and diluted earnings per share increased 1
percent to $1.63.

Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We're
off to a strong start. While making major brand investments to drive key
markets and implementing new accounting rules to include stock option
expenses, we continued to deliver strong top line growth and laid the
foundation for another successful year.

"We are confident in the year ahead, the fundamental strength of our
business and our brands. We continue to deliver breakthrough innovations,
like our global soccer initiative, Joga Bonito, and our Nike+ product
concept. We also see significant momentum across our brand portfolio with
strong performances from Converse, Brand Jordan and Nike Golf. "*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2006 through January 2007,
totaling $5.2 billion, 6 percent higher than such orders reported for the

significantly impact this growth.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 8 percent; Europe (which
includes the Middle East and Africa) increased 2 percent; Asia Pacific grew
11 percent; and the Americas declined 4 percent. Changes in currency

futures orders growth in Asia Pacific by 1 percentage point. In the Americas
region changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported futures growth
by 5 percentage points.*

* The marked paragraphs contain forward-looking statements that involve

reports filed by NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K.
Some forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in futures
orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for
subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and "at once" orders, exchange
rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a significant portion of
the business does not report futures orders.
