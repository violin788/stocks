Welcome to Nike's fiscal 2013 second quarter conference call. For those who need to reference today's press release you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations including equipment; NIKE Golf, Converse, and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.</font></div>

References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at Nike&#8217;s website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.</font></div>

NIKE, Inc. second-quarter revenues were up 7%. Excluding changes in currency, revenues were up 10%. That growth was well balanced across all brands, key NIKE Brand categories and nearly all geographies.&#160;&#160;Gross margin was down 30 basis points, better than projected and diluted Earnings per share growth outpaced revenue growth, up 11% to $1.14.</font></div>

And we have even more great opportunities coming up.

The word itself has become a bit of an industry free-for-all &#8211; it&#8217;s a technology, a platform, data, a product, a sensor, a service, a community.&#160;&#160;All true &#8211; but all short of their role at NIKE. I see digital as an amplifier. It highlights and expands the commitments we&#8217;ve had for decades.&#160;&#160;&#160;Listen to the athlete, connect with the consumer, enhance performance, expand the experience of sport, and help others and ourselves reach our full potential.</font></div>

We build a two-way dialogue with our consumers that enable them to connect with NIKE, and each other, in ways never before possible. This ensures our connections with consumers remain deep, meaningful, and relevant; which is at the heart of what NIKE&#8217;s been doing since we started.</font></div>

As we closed the sale of the Umbro brand in Q2 and we work to close the sale of Cole Haan in Q3, we&#8217;ll shift those management and financial resources to the greatest opportunities to create sustainable, profitable growth. With the divesture of these businesses, we haven&#8217;t changed our growth goals, we&#8217;ve highlighted them.&#160;&#160;We have even sharper focus on the tremendous potential in our core businesses, and we&#8217;re more confident than ever in our ability to realize that potential.</font></div>

This is counter-intuitive to some given this market&#8217;s size and assumed maturity. But I see tremendous growth potential in North America, fueled by our continued success in transforming the marketplace along category lines. Even more exciting, North America is a glimpse into the future.&#160;&#160;It&#8217;s a model for success we continue to adapt in key markets around the world.</font></div>

In over 30 years doing business there, we&#8217;ve learned a lot about the consumer, what they value, how they live, and what they want and expect from us.&#160;&#160;These insights have made NIKE the undisputed leader in this market and they shape our strategy as we work aggressively to position the marketplace for continued growth.</font></div>

We know we can do it, because we&#8217;ve done it before. And we&#8217;re confident we will continue to grow and lead this market. The progress will not always be linear &#8211; powerful change to unlock potential rarely is, but I truly believe NIKE&#8217;s long-term opportunity in China is enormous.</font></div>

Nearly every category was up, led by double-digit growth in Running, Basketball and Men&#8217;s Training.&#160;&#160;Footwear revenue increased 13%.

It was one of the most anticipated launches in Football - and in this market - in years.&#160;&#160;That alone says a lot about our role as an innovator. We delivered a new level of performance and style for every player in the NFL. The success is beyond our expectations, which were pretty high to begin with. We also see a ton of potential for our Amplify Sport strategy to expand the NFL business into every dimension of the athlete&#8216;s life &#8211; how they compete, how they train, and how they express themselves.&#160;&#160;The NFL license is a huge platform for innovation in product, brand and distribution &#8211; and not just in Football but across the whole of the Men&#8217;s Training category.&#160;&#160;There&#8217;s much more to come on that front.</font></div>

NIKE+ is a great example. It&#8217;s a product. It&#8217;s a platform for services. It&#8217;s an ongoing dialogue with our consumers.

With our connections to Chinese consumers; NIKE is the premium performance brand in China, and we&#8217;ll keep that distinction. We won&#8217;t sacrifice our brand or the trust of the consumer to chase opportunities not grounded in performance and sport. Anchoring our brand in authentic performance gives us the credibility and relevance to differentiate our products and brand from a sea of competitors. And as we&#8217;ve demonstrated in China and elsewhere around the world, that authenticity allows us to &#8220;Amplify Sport&#8221; and drive sustainable, profitable growth in our Training and Sportswear businesses as well. We believe this is highly relevant to the needs and aspirations of the Chinese consumer. And we&#8217;re committed to staying connected.</font></div>

We still expect to increase our square footage over time, but the retail footprint will evolve to bigger, better, more productive retail spaces. We&#8217;ve mapped the key shopping districts and we&#8217;re beginning to transform the distribution landscape, starting with the locations that matter most; generally the biggest urban centers and their most important shopping districts.&#160;&#160;We&#8217;re also increasing our focus on how to better leverage our supply chain and our centralized distribution center.</font></div>

In Q2 our DTC doors continued to perform well, delivering 10% comp store growth.&#160;&#160;And our wholesale partners have reported to us that they are seeing positive comp store growth and inventory levels in the market are beginning to come down. On a more surgical level, the specific wholesale partner doors we&#8217;ve transformed to align with the category offense are producing very solid early results and are delivering comp store growth at about twice the level of the overall fleet.&#160;&#160;Very similar to the results we&#8217;re seeing with this focus in the US market.</font></div>

As Mark said, we know what needs to be done in China, because we&#8217;ve successfully done it before.&#160;&#160;And we&#8217;re committed to continuing to invest in the three key areas that will set the stage for growth product, brand, and distribution.

Revenue across the geography is up 18%. That&#8217;s the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It&#8217;s happening across our biggest performance categories, especially Running and Football &#8211; where we still have enormous room to grow. And it&#8217;s not a single market driving those big numbers.&#160;&#160;It&#8217;s happening in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, as well as other developing markets around the globe.</font></div>

But bottom line was, we had pretty strong performance from the price increases we've taken over the last few seasons, and as I indicated, the combination of that and easing raw material costs is now offsetting some ongoing inflation in labor. We were only slightly down year-on-year, and a lot of that has to do with mix changes and currency. So bottom line is, we feel great about the trendline we're on in gross margin, I think its playing out as we expected it to. Our ability to forecast this thing with all the moving parts we have, I think this is pretty good shooting. And as you know, we don't manage one line out of the P&amp;L. We manage the whole thing. So we're pretty pleased at how the second quarter came out.</font></div>

I really appreciate all the detail Charlie walked us through with regards to all the strategies you're employing in China currently. And I was just wondering, it sounds like you're in the very early stages of doing a lot of the category offense. When can we start to see that be a little bit more prolific in the region, and when do you think that will start to contribute more effectively to any kind of inflection in the growth rate in China?</font></div>

We feel really good about what we're doing and how we're doing it. We're seeing great results in the specific locations that we've started to move forward to. So I think as we scale it, where you start to see the impact, it's hard for me to pick a quarter or a date, I would expect to see an increasing level of performance on a broader basis as we move down, quarter-to-quarter. So the goal obviously here is to be decisive and move quickly as we can. We've talked about that, the last 2 calls. I think some of the actions that we took over the last 90 days lead me to believe that we're moving both at an increased pace and in the right direction. The sooner we can get towards this market differentiation, consumer differentiation in the marketplace, the better off we're going to be, and we're taking early, small steps, but you can expect that to accelerate as we move forward.</font></div>

As Charlie said, we expect that to get better, but one of the things we're really focused on, is those underlying productivity metrics that are telling us that we're getting it right in the marketplace with the consumer, and that's why we're giving you that level of visibility.</font></div>

One is, the emphasis on working with the space that we have and making that space better, more productive and more profitable, and we think, probably a little bit bigger on a per location basis to storytell the way we do, so we're very good -- we're excited about that. And the other one is, focusing on the high end, the premium positioning of the brand. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward as well.</font></div>

I know it's been a long road with some of the volatility over the last few years, so it looks like it's starting to pay out, so congrats there. As we look back in time a little bit, you see gross margins peak out in about 2010. Obviously that was at the end of several years of currency going the right way. But if you look at that as where you peaked on past, how confident are you that you can get back there, if you are?

I mean, what we do is, we're focused on the key drivers that differentiate our product and our brand in the marketplace. A great example of that is the innovation that we bring into the marketplace. That is one of the things that lets you move your margins up because you've got premium differentiated product that the consumer's looking for and not everybody else has it. So our approach to growing margins has been focused on those basic fundamental levers of moving margins higher. We're confident we can continue to do that over the long period of time. Trying to pick a date or a destination point, given all the volatility there is in the world, is not something that we try to do.</font></div>

And did it come at the expense of Running, or how should we think about that as that gains steam?</font></div>

Hey, I'm going to take that, actually from a couple of different angles and give you some examples. First of all, the performance side of the business is very strong, and we're seeing some really great sell-throughs at retail on some of the new marquee product. And so that always makes us feel good. We always feel like we're headed in the right direction with that premium product. I think the other things that are starting to -- that you're starting to see is, a, a little bit more interest in basketball in Europe, we're excited about that, and that is coming at both the performance level, as well as an influence in sportswear. You're starting to see -- the basketball silhouettes outside the United States is becoming a little stronger. We're seeing styles like the Blazer in Western Europe becoming a very, very big franchise business for us, from a silhouette standpoint, and it's even creeping into the Women's business, whereas the Dunk Too High [ph] is a new shoe on the Women's side that is becoming, quite frankly, becoming a bit of a phenomena around the world. And so, we're very excited to see the influence of basketball becoming more influential around the world, both on the performance side as well as the sportswear side. So it's -- with our position in basketball, it bodes well for us over the near and mid-term.</font></div>

I wanted to ask you, you made some interesting comments upfront about digital and the importance of that as one of the key pillars of NIKE's opportunity to create shareholder value. As you think about e-commerce, how do you balance the Internet, and how the brand operates on the Internet, between kind of creating consumer connections and developing that relationship almost as a marketing vehicle, versus the commercial side of the business, where you drive it, as you utilize it and lever it is a profit driver. And I'd probably venture a guess that you guys are probably underpenetrated in terms of Internet as a sales mix, relative to some other discretionary brands out there. But I just want to see how you're thinking about that.</font></div>

It's all interrelated to your comment. Both the commerce side, the communications piece, the social networking that, we have a 2-way dialogue with the consumer. We enabled consumers to talk to each other. We are strengthening the relationship we have with the consumer. Certainty, not just through our communications, but also through the commerce side of things. And then, of course, the product and the services piece, which is in its infancy stages right now. But we expect big things out of that piece of our business. But the point is, this is all interrelated. And this is exactly how we're managing this part of our business. We have groups that are highly focused on each of these segments, but we also work this as a unified portfolio. And we see this is really the way that we're going to increase the power of the connection with the consumer, and then, to your point on the e-commerce piece is, we're going to drive a huge commercial opportunity in, yes, I think an underpenetrated channel for NIKE. But it's a real holistic view of the digital world and how it applies to NIKE and the massive potential that represents. These aren't separate silos. These are interrelated, and again, that's exactly how we're managing it.</font></div>

So we've got stronger growth in the front part of the window. With respect to pricing, one of the things we also spoke to is that we do believe that we think there's price opportunity out there on a season-by-season basis. We do not expect to be doing this across the board. Across the majority of the line, we think it's really more of a customer value equation assessment, where style by style, we're looking at the pricing. And particularly behind innovation, we think there's opportunity to move price up. But I don't think you're going to see the kinds of broad pricing actions going forward that you saw from us 1.5 years ago.</font></div>

And then, Charlie, can you elaborate some on the changes to the apparel direction in China, particularly the new silhouette for the consumer, and some of the performance direction of that product line that's resonating?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;: </font>Yes, I think, well -- one of the things, and we've talked about this in previous calls, the majority of our inventory issue in China is built -- basically built around a lot of the apparel product. And one of the things that we felt pretty strongly about was some of the fit opportunities we had in the marketplace. For holiday, and I alluded to that in the commentary, we started to move some of that new fit product into the market. It does not, by any means, represent even anywhere close to 100% that's in the market today, but it is very quickly becoming a higher percentage of the line as we move into spring, and then on into summer. The response that we're seeing there, both from a, obviously a sell-through standpoint, and the way we've been a little bit more focused around the Chinese consumer silhouette-wise, that new product is moving through the marketplace at a very nice pace. And we're very, very comfortable with it, and quite frankly, happy with it. We've got to get more and more of that part of the apparel line into the marketplace, which the plan is to do as we move forward into spring and summer.</font></div>

And then turning to -- in the product pipeline, obviously you've had a ton of great innovation, expect that to continue, you mentioned digital. Maybe specifically, as it relates to Flyknit, certainly a really big opportunity, but maybe help us think about the cadence, how that business ramps from a top line perspective in terms of incremental distribution? And how we should think that from a volume basis, maybe over the next 12 months? And then certainly from a profitability perspective, what type of scale do you need in terms of really getting a nice margin that's given -- that it doesn't have labor, or very little labor associated with it?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font> Yes, this is Mark. I'm going to jump in on that. The Flyknit as you said, we're quite bullish on that opportunity. I think it's going to take a little while, meaning 12-plus months or so to really get this to a meaningful scale in terms of some of those numbers that are going to have a more dramatic impact on the units and the overall margin numbers. We are very bullish on -- of scaling the manufacturing capability, the capacity. There is obviously, from our vantage point, a huge consumer appetite for this product, so we're balancing the aggressiveness to close that gap and meet that demand, and make sure that we're not getting out ahead of ourselves. So we don't -- we're not creating excess demand that we can't meet in the marketplace. So I think it's going to take -- it's going to ramp up consistently and aggressively over the next 12 months and beyond. And I think you'll continue to see this become frankly, a bigger and bigger percentage of our total footwear focus. And it'll expand, I think dramatically from a category basis as well. Many of our innovations really start in Running. And then they move and are leveraged into other categories. And Flyknit is certainly no exception. Some of the most dramatic and innovative and exciting product that I've seen behind the door there, that I can't really get into with you all right now, is in this Flyknit area and across some of the other categories. So it's a huge part of our future, and I think from a units and a margin standpoint, you'll see that continue to get bigger and bigger.</font></div>

We are really bullish on what the potential is here. At this point, it is half the shoe, if you will. And so we're working on putting all of the pieces together. So I want to put that in that context. The second thing is that, the trendline we've seen consistently as we launch new technologies is that, we launch them, and then we work our way down the cost curve. So our products tend to get more profitable the longer we work with that particular technology, and we believe Flyknit will certainly be consistent with that.</font></div>

Sort of where do you stand in terms of that, what maybe what inning, in terms of penetration, kind of the incremental opportunity be it in those doors or sort of other areas that continue to sort of drive productivity with those wholesale partners?</font></div>

Well, I'm going to -- I guess, if I understand your question, one of the things that obviously we can do is more of them here in the U.S. Now we used those examples because most of the group is most familiar with those examples here in the US. We actually have a lot of that type of activity going on in other markets around the world. We have some great soccer or football spaces in Europe that are performing extremely well, and we're very excited about scaling those, along with the examples that we've given you in the U.S. The other thing that it provides us is great learnings that we take to a market like China or Korea in a mono brand space, where we can really take the category offense and use the amplified execution in performance, Training and sportswear, to really bring productivity and profitability to the mono brand spaces that we have in marketplaces like that. And so, some of the references that we've made in China some of the things we're starting to do in places like Shanghai, is starting to bring some of that category focus into these spaces that -- and we're seeing a lift, both from a consumer response standpoint, and obviously from a productivity and profitability standpoint.</font></div>

Is Free as -- excuse me, is Flyknit as big an opportunity? And how does it cross categories? Does it has to -- does the idea have stability enough to make a Flyknit basketball shoe, I mean, down the road, or is it more Running-oriented? You talked a little bit about that.</font></div>

I'll talk a little bit about that, but not too much, for hopefully obvious reasons. Let me say I am incredibly bullish, I mean, I'm a product -- self-admitted product geek here, and very important, not only to me, but this company, it's the basis of our success. So we're very discriminating on new technologies like Flyknit. And feel this is one of those technologies that has incredibly massive potential, let me put it that way. Not only within Running, as I said before, but across multiple categories. What form that takes, you'll see. I mean, that's all I can say. It'll-- you can't judge the applicability of Flyknit based on the products that you've seen to date. This technology has tremendous potential, tremendous possibilities, and as I said, some of the most exciting product we have in the pipeline is involving the use of Flyknit technology. And as Charlie mentioned in his note, the impact on performance, on the aesthetic, on sustainability, all these factors are tremendous. And again, well beyond Running.</font></div>

But if he's a self-professed product geek, I guess, I'm known as one of the more commercial-minded guys around here. But I think that I would only echo all of the commentary in the sense that, I think we've both been around here a long time. We've seen a lot of innovation come and go through this place, and I think Flyknit represents one of those bigger opportunities that we all get so excited about. So, and one thing that I think we've overemphasized too, is that we feel that strongly about it, we're going to manage it, and we're going to ramp it at appropriate level, both the way it ramps commercially and the way that you'd see it transform the way that footwear is used by the athlete. So it's exciting times.</font></div>
