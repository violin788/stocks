       NIKE REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.14,
                  UP 18 PERCENT FROM PRIOR YEAR

       Worldwide futures orders up 2.5 percent, up 7 percent
               excluding effects of foreign currency

Beaverton, OR (December 20, 2005) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
record results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2005.  Second
quarter revenues increased 10 percent to $3.5 billion, compared to $3.1
billion for the same period last year. Net income grew 15 percent to
$301.1 million, compared to $261.9 million, and diluted earnings per share
grew 18 percent to $1.14, versus $0.97 in the prior year.

"Led by the outstanding performance of the Nike brand in the U.S. and
Americas regions, we delivered strong growth in revenue and profitability
in the second quarter," said William D. Perez, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Nike, Inc.  "In addition to the Nike brand, our Other
businesses also delivered double digit growth in revenue and profits. The
power of our Nike, Inc. portfolio was evident this quarter, with strength
in the U.S., China and Latin America balancing more challenging results in
Western Europe and Japan. We feel very good about our business overall,
and our prospects for delivering on our financial goals for the fiscal
year." *

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2005 through April 2006,
totaling $5.2 billion, two and a half percent higher than such orders
reported for the same period last year.  Changes in currency exchange
rates significantly reduced this growth relative to recent quarters, as
global futures orders grew by seven percent excluding the impact of
currency changes.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased nine percent; Europe
(which includes the Middle East and Africa) declined six percent; Asia
Pacific grew two percent; and the Americas increased 23 percent.  Changes
in currency exchange rates reduced the reported futures orders by eight
percentage points in Europe and by seven percentage points in the Asia
Pacific region.  In the Americas region, three percentage points of the
increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates.*

1 The Company evaluates performance of individual operating segments
based on pre-tax income.  Total pre-tax income equals Income before
income taxes as shown on the Consolidated Income Statement.

2 "Corporate" represents items necessary to reconcile to total pre-tax
income, which includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the
operating segments for management reporting and intercompany
eliminations for specific items in the Consolidated Income Statement.

* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2006 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously
reported results of operations or shareholders' equity.
