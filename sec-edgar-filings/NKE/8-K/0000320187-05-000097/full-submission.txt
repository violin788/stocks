               NIKE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.61

              Sales gains across all regions and product business units

                    Worldwide futures orders up 11 percent


Beaverton, OR (September 19, 2005) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
record results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2005.  Revenue grew
eight percent and earnings per diluted share increased 33 percent for the
period.  The Company reported sales growth across each of its regions and
product business units, with particular strength in US footwear in the
quarter for both revenues and futures orders.

First quarter revenues increased eight percent to $3.9 billion, compared to
$3.6 billion for the same period last year. Net income grew 32 percent to
$432.3 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, compared to $326.8 million, or
$1.21 per diluted share, for the prior year.

"A strong product pipeline and our global management team's ability to
consistently execute across our brand portfolio drove very strong performance
for the first quarter," said William D. Perez, President and Chief Executive
Officer. "Our results show continued healthy demand for NIKE product
worldwide and we remain optimistic about our ability to meet our future
goals."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2005 through January 2006,
totaling $4.9 billion, 11.0 percent higher than such orders reported for the
same period last year.  Changes in currency exchange rates had no significant
impact on this growth.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 12 percent; Europe (which
includes the Middle East and Africa) increased four percent; Asia Pacific grew
15 percent; and the Americas increased 32 percent.  Changes in currency
exchange rates reduced the reported futures orders growth in Europe by two
percentage points.  Futures orders growth in Asia Pacific was not
significantly impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In the Americas
region, three percentage points of the increase were due to changes in
currency exchange rates.*

increased 14 percent to $97.2 million.   Pre-tax income rose 34 percent to

compared to $406.0 million a year ago.  Three percentage points of this

Income Statement Review

Gross margins were 45.3 percent compared to 44.5 percent last year. Selling
and administrative expenses were 28.6 percent of first quarter revenues,
compared to 30.1 percent last year.  This decrease in selling and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was due, in part, to a
change in timing of certain marketing expenses.  The effective tax rate for
the first quarter was 34.5 percent.

At quarter end, global inventories stood at $1.9 billion, an increase of 11
percent from August 31, 2004.  Cash and short-term investments were $1.9
billion at the end of the quarter, compared to $1.3 billion last year.


Share Repurchase

During the quarter, the Company purchased a total of 1,832,500 shares for
approximately $151 million in conjunction with the Company's four-year,

which includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating segments
for management reporting and intercompany eliminations for specific items in the
Consolidated Income Statement.

* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year
2006 presentation. These changes had no impact on previously reported results of
