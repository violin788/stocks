Welcome to NIKE's fiscal 2012 first-quarter conference call. </font><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">For those who need to reference today's press release, you will find it at www.nikebiz.com. </font><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.</font></div>

Those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total Revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of Futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, and discounts which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

Wholesale equivalent sales include both reported revenue and estimations of sales by licensees based on the royalties paid. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc., and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.</font></div>

Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two.

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">At our investor day in June, we outlined some exciting opportunities and goals for our brands and the Company. Reaching those goals starts with our relentless focus on creating innovative and compelling products for our consumers every day. Q1 shows how we're delivering on our commitments.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">NIKE, Inc. Revenues for the first quarter were up 18% to $6.1 billion. In line with our expectations, Gross Margins were down 270 basis points to 44.3%. In spite of that, diluted earnings per share of $1.36 were up 19%. Those numbers do a great job of reinforcing that NIKE, Inc. is a growth company, and our growth is accelerating.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We all know that the economic uncertainty that we're seeing in the world today is putting pressure on consumers, around the world. Yet, in most countries, we continue to see solid growth in Footwear and Apparel sales, which tells me the growing middle class in developing markets is increasing consumption and that consumers everywhere are ready to buy when they feel good about what they get for their money.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">At the same time, some countries face low or no growth, while others work to avoid overheating. Some consumers have returned to higher-end goods while others are trading down or cutting back. These conditions place a premium on companies like NIKE, Inc. with broadly diversified businesses that are not over-reliant on any one market, one price point, or one consumer demographic.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As always, our strength starts with the consumer. We connect with them in truly deep and meaningful ways. They want authentic brands, innovative products, and powerful experiences in-store, online, and out in the world. That's what we deliver, and we do it through the category offense. It's a core part of our growth strategy, and as you can see, it's gaining traction across the NIKE Brand. The better we get at running this offense, the stronger results we see.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Running, it's how we create NIKE+, the biggest running club on the planet, along with hundreds of races around the world. In action sports, it creates the BMX park we built in East London, or the U.S. Open of Surfing at Huntington Beach.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Football, it's Umbro and Liam Gallagher launching England's new national team home jersey. In basketball, it's marquee heroes like Kobe, LeBron, Dwyane, 'melo, Kevin Durant and Chris Paul, all inspiring hundreds of thousands of kids on the playgrounds of Shanghai and Beijing over this past summer.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We have the most innovative point of contact with consumers of anyone in our industry, and that's a huge competitive advantage. In times like these when uncertainty is the new normal, the strength of our balance sheet, the breadth of our business portfolio and the depth of our management experience, what we call the power of the portfolio, all give us the edge in delivering profitable, long-term growth in a variety of conditions.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">For several quarters, we've spoken about headwinds from rising product costs for labor, materials, and freight. Although we did see benefits from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives and some price increases for fall, our Gross Margins fell in the first quarter, as expected. Expect our Gross Margins will continue to be below prior-year levels in the near term with an improving trend in the back half of the fiscal year as input costs begin to stabilize, airfreight comes down, and price increases take effect for the holiday, spring and summer seasons.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">While the economic recovery continues to see traction, we're focused on optimizing the investments we've made to grow. Sixteen months ago, we outlined a five-year plan to invest $500 million to $600 million in our Direct to Consumer business. The strategy was driven more than just by top or bottom line growth, DTC exists to grow and transform the broader marketplace. You'll hear from Charlie on how our Q1 results in North America are a great illustration of our early returns on that investment.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We've built in key locations. Our burgeoning E-commerce business is up more than 30% in Q1, and our portfolio of high volume factory stores is reaching value consumers and helping to manage inventory.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We're also leveraging our experiences and operational capabilities to help our wholesale partners lift and differentiate NIKE in their stores. All of that makes us a better retailer, a better wholesaler, and a better company. I'm very pleased with this investment so far, especially as we leverage DTC across categories, brands and geographies.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And of course, we continue our relentless commitment to product innovation. In fact, the Patent Board just named NIKE the number one company on its Consumer Products List of Innovators. They based it on our commitment to research, technical ability, quantity, relevance of research, and speed of innovation. It's innovations like NIKE FREE, lunar cushioning and Pro Combat that have already delivered strong returns. But they're still in the early stages of design development and commercial potential. NIKE FREE, for example, has helped fuel the growth in Running, a category that's up double digits again this quarter, and is now spreading across other categories like Men's and Women's Training, Basketball and Sportswear.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We have the same upside in established product icons like Hurley's Phantom Board Short and the Converse Chuck Taylor franchise. In fact, I see more opportunity today than ever before to leverage our innovations across categories and brands.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I can tell you we'll be unveiling some powerful innovation leading up to the holiday season and on through the Olympics, real, tangible game-changing products and services, especially in digital. We started leveraging digital technology on the product side more than ten years ago with NIKEiD, our first customization service. From there, we introduce NIKE+, and both continue to evolve and expand across our portfolio.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Today, digital technology affects every part of our business -- product design and production, consumer experiences, commerce, and then how we connect and communicate. Digital is a huge priority for us.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Finally, we're uniquely able to leverage the passion of sport. I'm really excited about 2012. It's going to be a very big year in sports, BCS and March Madness at the college level, the European Championships and the London Olympics on the world stage, and of course the beginning of a new era in the NFL.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I've seen the early concept and design work on the NFL and it's truly amazing. I look forward to rolling out that story as we approach the 2012/'13 season. All of these moments really serve to inspire us and drive us to achieve our full potential. We'll be aggressive in leveraging the power of NIKE -- of NIKE, Inc. -- to do what we do best, and that's to innovate to serve the athlete, to grow the Company, and to inspire the world.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Charlie Denson, President, NIKE Brand:</font> Thanks Mark. Hello everybody.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">When I look at Q1, I see the power of the NIKE Brand leveraging opportunity in local markets as well as in the global economy. Let's look at how that translates into results on a constant-dollar basis.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our Revenues grew 12% and our Futures are up 13%. We grew in every geography except Western Europe, which was flat, and six of our seven key sport categories. NIKE Brand DTC was up over 20%, including over 30% growth in our online business. Comp store Revenue growth was strong at both factory and in-line locations. Pretty impressive results, and I point out that our category offense is the driving force, harnessing the power of the NIKE Brand to serve athletes. That is what we do best -- help athletes compete, train, and express themselves, and of course generate growth.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Running and Basketball are two great examples. Let's look at Running first. As you know, we grew the category 30% in fiscal year '11, and that momentum continued in Q1 with Revenue and Futures up strong double digits. Running is one of our most important innovation engines. Lunar technology, Dynamic Support, the Tempo Short and NIKE FREE all came out of the Running category.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">During Q1 alone, we launched the LunarGlide 3 to expand our leadership position in dynamic support and lightweight running. Sell-through has been very strong. NIKE+ added a new smartphone app and grew membership 50% to reach 5 million runners. We connected with over 30,000 runners in key cities across China during our Lunar Run events.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Running as a tremendous global opportunity for the NIKE Brand. It's a bedrock category, a strong driver of our Women's business, and a highly accessible and relevant sport, whether you're a cross-country athlete in Pennsylvania, a fitness runner in Shanghai, or a trail runner in Germany. It's also a great example of what we call "amplify sport". Amplify sport is a leverage model. We take the technology, design and brand energy we create on the performance side of the business and use that to drive growth on the sportswear side. In this case, we've taken it a step further and created a performance aesthetic in running that is embraced by runners and non-runners alike. NIKE is the brand of choice.</font></div>

It's always been a strong business for NIKE, but 18 months ago, we saw the start of a new era, so we decided to add a little fuel to the fire. We doubled our innovation agenda in products, led with the Kobe and LeBron franchises, and with lighter, better-fitting, more relevant silhouettes in Apparel. We leveraged the synergies of our three brands, NIKE Basketball, Converse and Brand Jordan. We brought those brands together to celebrate the global game at the World Basketball Festival last summer in New York. We took the game and its heroes on the road to China this past summer. We commercialized all of it in the premier retail destinations for that consumer, our NIKE stores and our House of Hoops locations with Footlocker.</font></div>

Will that energy continue if the NBA lockout continues? I believe it will. Basketball never stops. It's truly becoming a global game. Between international leagues, national team play, the upcoming Olympics, the college game here in the US, we see Basketball continuing to grow.</font></div>

The way we're growing NIKE Pro is really a snapshot of our larger strategy in Apparel. That's a relentless focus on performance. In the US, NIKE Pro continues to be the leading base layer brand for women and over the last month, we've continued to close the gap in Men's. Innovation is where the real potential is for a Apparel in our industry, and we own that space.</font></div>

In Q1, performance Apparel was up double digits and it's the main driver for our growth inside our sports categories. At the same time, it's a powerful influence in making Sportswear more premium and differentiated in this competitive environment.</font></div>

NIKE FREE continues to provide authentic training benefits, and our tops, bras and bottoms businesses are driving tremendous sell-through at retail. We saw double-digit growth in Footwear and Apparel, and increased revenue in every geography. Globally, Women's Training is up strong double digits with a particularly strong Q1 in North America.</font></div>

That insight and the ability to execute on it is unique in the women's marketplace.</font></div>

Lots of energy in some of our new formats, online and with our factory stores. As you know, the strategy for DTC focuses on transforming the marketplace. As Mark said, this has been a very powerful investment for us. We're elevating the consumer experience across our portfolio of stores in multi-category brand stores, single-category stores, online and in our factory format. It's a very effective way to showcase our brand and give consumers more knowledge, more excitement, and of course more reasons to buy NIKE. That creates more capacity in the marketplace.</font></div>

NIKE-only concepts like Dick's Field House, the Finish Line's Track Club in House of Hoops with Footlocker are rewarding consumers with authentic and compelling buying experiences. When we look at the success of House of Hoops and its expansion into Europe, it's easy to see how these concepts can be scaled and exported around the world.</font></div>

That demand is driving our growth and our profitability. That strong demand, coupled with the higher product costs Mark mentioned, inventory levels relative to sales are returning to where they were prior to the downturn in calendar 2008.</font></div>

In greater China, our business posted solid growth of 9% in Q1. Running delivered strong double-digit growth and Footwear is especially strong, up 21% for the quarter in this performance market.</font></div>

That's the amplified sport strategy in action. A performance-centric assortment is more relevant to the consumer and it's a more effective way to leverage our selling price in-store -- selling space in-store. As a result, we've taken actions in Q1 to begin repositioning the marketplace, which is reflected in the Q1 Revenue results for Apparel, which were down 8% for the quarter. We expect the slowing impact of this repositioning to be temporary on the China Apparel business and remain very confident in our ability to drive growth over the long term. We're the clear leader in authenticity and relevance in China and will continue to invest in creating separation for the NIKE Brand in this key market.</font></div>

In Q1, Revenues were flat as we faced challenging comparisons to the World Cup last year, and some negative impact of product shipment timing. But with that said, we can do a better job here, and we will.</font></div>

With this region's incredible passion for sports and performance, you can be sure we'll take advantage of 2012 to celebrate our athletes and showcase the next generation of NIKE innovation. Lots more to come on that front.</font></div>

North America Revenues grew 15%, a fantastic performance. There are many factors at work here -- our innovative product, the strength of our DTC business which posted 23% growth for North America in Q1, and our continued momentum in Running, Basketball, and Men's and Women's Training. In fact, Footwear Apparel in every category were up in Q1. Now that's what I call the definition of a complete offense.</font></div>

This focus, along with improved execution, is driving our growth by developing compelling, consumer experiences that truly showcase the innovative products of the NIKE Brand. We are starting to see the creation of a bigger and more compelling marketplace. That type of growth in a developed market like North America is a real testament to our growth strategy, our execution, and our partnerships. We're going to leverage that momentum.</font></div>

Our strategy of investing in key products, categories and markets that drive the most growth continues to pay off. We're elevating the level and consistency of NIKE wherever consumers find it. We continue to expand the marketplace, gain share, and create separation.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">On today's call, I want to focus on three key themes that are driving our financial results and outlook -- first, that our category offense is driving sustainable, profitable growth; second, that the strength of our portfolio positions us to outperform in a volatile environment; and third, that we remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value. So let me expand on each of those themes.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The first theme is driving sustainable, profitable growth with our category offense. The strength of our Q1 Revenues and Futures demonstrates that our category offense is powering growth even against the backdrop of weak global economies. Since inception, the category offense has enabled us to connect our Brands more deeply with consumers and deliver more innovative, differentiated products.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In recent quarters, we've also gained momentum along a third dimension, transforming the retail marketplace. In our Direct to Consumer operations and with our wholesale partners, we're delivering compelling category experiences in-store and online. The combination of category focused brand, product and retail experiences is driving extraordinary growth, even in an uncertain environment.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The second theme is the power of the portfolio that Mark spoke to earlier. The scale and diversification of NIKE, Inc. gives us confidence that we can deliver on our financial goals even in the face of ongoing market volatility. In this environment, companies need to operate efficiently and manage risk. They also need to invest to drive growth. The power of the NIKE portfolio lets us do both. Macro-economic uncertainty is the new normal, and companies like NIKE with financial strength, diversified businesses, and experience managing a global business under a variety of conditions will have the edge.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The third theme is our ongoing focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Investments we've made over time in product innovation, brand building and marketplace transformation are the engines that delivered outstanding performance in Q1. Those results illustrate our ability to simultaneously deliver topline growth, bottom-line profitability, and strong returns on invested capital. Going forward, we'll continue to invest in our business to drive long-term growth, deliver near-term profitability and take steps to manage risk.</font></div>

Reported Revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 18%, up 11% on a currency neutral basis. Constant currency Revenues were higher than we had expected due to strength around the world, particularly in North America. The impact of currency was also higher than in last quarter's guidance due largely to the strength of the yen and emerging market currencies.</font></div>

These negative effects were partially offset by strong growth in our Direct to Consumer business, modest price increases, and the benefit of our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives.</font></div>

As I noted earlier, our goal is to create shareholder value by delivering profitable growth in a capital efficient way. Our return on invested capital for the last four quarters was 22.6%, up 1.9 points versus the previous four-quarter period.</font></div>

Unit inventories for the NIKE Brand increased 34% driven primarily by higher Futures orders, more timely factory deliveries, and prebuilds for long leadtime products such as outerwear and NIKE Pro.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Overall, we're comfortable with our inventory. It's concentrated in geographies and categories where demand remains strong, and the proportion of closeouts is in line with historic levels. As Charlie indicated, we have great visibility into our supply chain and a global network of factory stores that provide an effective and profitable mechanism for clearing excess product.</font></div>

At this point, we believe unit inventory levels will peak in the second quarter and then be essentially flat over the balance of the fiscal year. However, when compared to unusually low levels of inventory last year, we expect the rate of inventory growth will be above revenue growth until at least the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.</font></div>

On a reported basis, Revenues for Western Europe were up 14%, but EBIT fell 21%, driven by lower Gross Margins and higher SG&amp;A.

On a currency-neutral basis, Q1 Revenues grew 5%, driven by strong growth in performance categories such as Running, Football and Women's Training.

Every category and territory posted higher Revenues with Argentina, Mexico and Korea driving the largest share of the growth. Currency-neutral Futures grew 21% with all categories except Action Sports up double digits. EBIT for the emerging markets increased 53%, driven by revenue growth, SG&amp;A leverage, and favorable foreign exchange, which more than offset lower Gross Margins.</font></div>

The increase was driven by double-digit growth at Converse and NIKE Golf, and single-digit growth at Cole Haan. Sales declined at Hurley and Umbro, the latter reflecting comparisons to World Cup sales last year. EBIT for the Other businesses decreased 21% as product input cost increases eroded Gross Margins and SG&amp;A deleveraged.</font></div>

For the full fiscal year, we now expect reported revenue growth in the low to mid teens, reflecting the continued strength of our underlying business and the impact of our planned price increases in the second half of the year.</font></div>

As a result, we expect Q2 Gross Margin will be down approximately 200 basis points versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect Gross Margin will be down at least 100 basis points with improving Gross Margin trends in the second half as higher prices take effect.</font></div>

For the full year, we expect more modest leverage with SG&amp;A growth in the low to mid teens with spending weighted toward the second half of the year in support of the European Football Championships and the London Olympics.</font></div>

I guess the first question that I have is a lot of focus these days on Europe. I was just wondering if you could sort of elaborate a little bit more, Southern Europe and what you're seeing in Italy or Spain or any more just in terms of that market, elaborate a little bit more versus what you've done already.</font></div>

I think -- as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the bad part is obviously it's a tougher economic situation. We hurt ourselves a little bit this past quarter with some of our deliveries, and we are obviously anniversarying the World Cup.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The good news is our DTC division reported very strong growth, and we're very happy to hear and see that. We feel really good about our business in Germany and France; they had good quarters. France, obviously the launch of the national team is the start of a very long and prosperous relationship there. We feel very good about our performance in Germany.</font></div>

The development of the category offense specifically in Football is a focal point for us, and we feel good about our direction there. Like I said, we're really looking forward to this with the Olympics and the Euro Champs both happening within literally 60 days of each other. We have an amazing pipeline of innovation that we're looking forward to, and I'm still pretty bullish on Europe long-term. We've got some work to do, but I'm very bullish long-term.</font></div>

My second question is, Don, on the inventory levels, when you look at the dollar number of where NIKE is today, I guess when you look at the industry, you appear to be very comfortable with where you are with this dollar increase, and you give us a little more on what to expect. But when you look closely at the industry in terms of the supply/demand piece of across the board locally, how comfortable are you with where retail inventories are planned and where the competitive set is today versus where the NIKE dollars are today?</font></div>

One of the things that we've talked about a lot is the only thing we really control is our own destination, our own future. That's one we feel very comfortable with. Our closeout business continues to be very much in line with growth. Then if you look at the overall numbers in units versus value right now, the value is much higher than the units, some of it because of the success we're having at the premium end of the business, and some of it is around some of the Apparel figures which relies -- or reverts back to a much higher commitment to the outerwear business, which is a higher price point business this fall that we're actually looking very much forward to. I think when you look at the overall industry, it certainly -- as the numbers have been released over the last couple of weeks and months, it's certainly something that's on our radar screen and we're very, very sensitive to and we're watching it very, very closely.</font></div>

I think, at this point, we've got very differentiated product in the marketplace. The brand is very strong. As Charlie mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have great visibility into the supply chain and our outlet store network has never been more productive as a vehicle for managing the marketplace. So in terms of the tools we have, the visibility we have and just the overall level of confidence in the product and the brand, we feel like we're in really good shape.</font></div>

Hey guys. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit. You talked about the success that you're seeing in North America, particularly I think on some of the retail presentation initiatives and that market being ahead of where you are in Europe and in Asia. Can you talk about some of the things that you can do or are thinking about in Europe and Asia when it comes to affecting retail presentation and when we should think about those changes starting to roll in?</font></div>

I think -- well, in Europe, you're starting to see some of the new brand presentation stores roll out. We've got a new running store in London that we're extremely excited about down in the Soho area. So you're starting to see a couple of those executions in Europe.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As far as China goes, Mark just mentioned to me also the House of Hoops program, which we're rolling out in Europe, has seen -- actually we were bullish going in, and it's outperformed our expectations.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I'll move back over to Asia now. I think what you're seeing in Asia, we've got the new store in Hong Kong -- I mean in Tokyo, a good store. It's still a challenging marketplace that we're dealing with there. I think, again, we remain bullish long-term, but it's got some short-term issues coming off of the disasters that we saw there last spring.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Then when you look at China, the biggest opportunity there is continuing to define the most productive size of the space and what it represents. We're working with the China team and some of our major customers there to better define our productivity levels and to continue to maintain our ability to grow the brand and the business in China. So you will start to see more and more of it in Europe over the next 6 to 12 months, and China will be an evolution of the space that we currently really work together with our partners to control in the mono-brand environment.</font></div>

Then I was wondering if you guys could also dig a little bit more into some of the regional profitability differences with the US seeing such strong leverage, emerging markets seeing such strong leverage and then still some pressure in Europe and in China from a profit perspective this quarter. What are the difference in the investments you're making by region that are creating those differences?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> It's not always something you can read on a quarter-by-quarter basis. For example, as you were referencing, both Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe were under some pressure from a profitability standpoint this quarter, but some of that relates to currency that, if you recall, we're on about a one-year lag on currency. So a lot of that product is coming through in euros, and so as the euro changed over time, those markets were under some pressure.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">If you go to China, we made decisions to continue to make investments in China. As you know, as Charlie just said, we had a little bit of a temporary slowdown in revenue for this quarter, but in the long run, we're very confident in the growth in that market. So these are really more quarter-to-quarter noise I would say as opposed to really long-term changes in probability. All of the markets that you mentioned, for example China and North America, very, very profitable on an absolute basis.</font></div>

I think obviously our investments are made against our biggest growth opportunities, but I would go back to that category offense and our ability to execute at a very high level right now in North America. Even though I don't think we're at maximum capacity or efficiency, I think we're really starting to find our stride and I think that's -- I think the upside is to continue to see that develop in some of the other geographies.</font></div>

Thanks for taking my questions. So yes, I guess, Mark or Charlie, if you could maybe talk about the planned price increases coming through, obviously a bit here in holiday but more broad in spring of '12. Relative to since the last time we got together, macro is seemingly deteriorating a bit here, particularly in developed US and Europe. Just against that backdrop, how you think about the price increases, are you shifting any of that maybe more towards the developing regions?</font></div>

We have, as Don pointed out very well, our brand strength, the strength of our product that's in the pipeline coming for spring when we're going to see the bulk of those price increases take effect. We really feel like we're in a great position to cover those price increases really better than anybody else in the industry. So I'm not overly concerned, but we are keeping a close eye on that, as we are with the rest of the industry. But I think we're in the best position to really take on those price increases at this point in time.</font></div>

So, we're still feeling pretty comfortable and confident that we have the price-value relationship in the product itself, in the innovation that we're bringing to the market, that so far certainly in the buying process we're not seeing any material impact.</font></div>

Maybe just to follow on the G&amp;A sort of cadence as we think about the year, obviously it starts to pick up in the Feb. and May quarters ahead of the London Olympics from a demand creation standpoint. But with those higher price increases coming through a higher top line, is there a potential that you're able to flex the model, get a little bit more leverage on that relative to perhaps these platforms in the past, or just how we should think about the G&amp;A build as we move through the year?</font></div>

At this point, as you put your finger on it, we have strategies that are really resonating in the marketplace. We feel terrific about the momentum in our business. At this point, we think that's a great investment to make to continue to drive the growth. So we do believe we're going to get some leverage, we've talked about that, but at this stage, we think we've got the balance right.</font></div>

As Mark mentioned, I think we had our biggest contingent I guess in China this summer as we've ever had.

What's going on in the NCAA right now with all the talk on conference realignment and what its impact is, I think the NCAA tournament this year could be as good as ever and we're very excited about that. So between NCAA, the buildup globally to the Olympics around the international team play, and then I think the anticipation of hopefully that the NBA does work out and get a season in, we still think basketball -- we're very, very bullish on basketball, as you would expect.</font></div>

My first question is just, Charlie, going back to a comment you made earlier, when you talked about spring bookings and how you had not seen any resistance to price increases, I was wondering if you talked a little bit about anything as it pertains to units, either by geography or category. Within the actual backlog number you put up of 13% currency neutral, within that number, can you break out between price and unit as it stands today?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;: </font>Well, the prices do kick in a little bit in fall, a little bit more in holiday, and then a little more substantial for spring. Right now, we are seeing in our Futures a low to mid single-digit growth in average selling price on both the Footwear and Apparel side. If you look at our numbers for the Q1 we just reported in revenue, it was up marginally. So as you would expect, the math is showing that there is an increasing level of expansion in average selling price.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Chris Svezia &gt;:</font> Okay. Then on the -- just going back to basketball for one second, when you guys think about the Jordan Brand domestically and the launch schedule, any thoughts at all to how that might change whether the NBA is playing or not, or is that completely independent of itself? Just any thoughts about how you're thinking about basketball launches going through fall and into holiday domestically.</font></div>

So you may see some of the NBA players' signature models maybe show up on some college teams where maybe you wouldn't have seen that if we were launching with the player himself. But other than that, no material changes in the strategy with regards to the new product. It's actually -- I think I'm not sure if you've seen any of it, but it's great stuff. We can't wait to get it into the marketplace. So, we'll find the best vehicle that exists, depending on how this whole thing plays itself out.</font></div>

I may have to ask a few questions then. I just want to follow up on basketball because I'm curious. When you look at your Futures orders, Charlie, I think you said they're up double digits in basketball at the end of the first quarter. But I'm curious how that might break out by geography. I don't know if you can give us any help there, because it doesn't sound like your customers are backing away from the category. I'm guessing it's just more a global game today than it was for you guys back in '99 during the last lockout. I'm wondering if you're seeing maybe some pull-back from customers in North America but that's being offset by continued momentum in let's say China or Europe or Latin America.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> Yes, no, the North American consumer is definitely not backing off at all. In fact, they're actually amping up. So obviously it's the biggest piece of the business, so it drives a good chunk of the number itself. But China is continuing to do very well. What we're actually probably the most excited about, albeit very small at this point, is the increasing level of interest around basketball in Europe. I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks or one of the earlier questions, it continues to out-index most of the stores that we're putting in. The success of the House of Hoops program with Footlocker continues to be very exciting. I think we're looking at a couple of new locations in Central and Eastern Europe, which I think Kobe may even have an opportunity to show up in the next couple of weeks.</font></div>

I appreciate that. Then on the Futures in general, you guys have referenced spring orders I think a couple of times on this call. I'm just kind of wondering how the spring order portion of the Futures looks compared to the balance. Maybe you could talk about the Futures sort of first-half versus second half of the window, what side of that is stronger?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> They are slightly stronger in the first half of the window, but we've only got one month of spring in at this point in time. It's at the very tail end of the Futures window. So that's not necessarily going to give you the complete picture on spring.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Mitch Kummetz, &gt;:</font> Then the last question, Don, on the margins, you mentioned some markdowns on the first quarter that was a bit of a drag on gross margin. Could you tell us how much of a drag that was and if there's any expectation that markdowns are going to be a drag on gross margin in Q2?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> No. When you say markdowns were a drag, that's not -- basically last year we had very low levels of closeout, and we saw a return to a little bit more normalized level of closeouts. I wouldn't characterize it as a drag. I think that what we're seeing now in a lot of parts of the business is just a little bit more of a normalization as the growth returns.</font></div>

I said we expected the future on other income and expense to be roughly about the average of the last couple of quarters. I just wanted to make sure that people heard it that way. The last three quarters, we've had the number, some up some down. It's basically plus or minus around zero. So the point I'm trying to make here is it's not a big driver of the income and it's plus or minus around zero. So I just wanted to clarify that answer.</font></div>
