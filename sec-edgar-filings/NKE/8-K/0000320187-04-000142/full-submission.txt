Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On July 30, 2004, NIKE, Inc. issued the following press release which is
furnished below:


                       FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

           INVESTOR CONTACT:                  MEDIA CONTACT:
           Fred Buonocore                     Joani Komlos
           503.671.6882                       503.671.2013


                 STATEMENT BY NIKE, INC. REGARDING
      UPDATED FUTURES INFORMATION IN FISCAL YEAR 2004 10-K

Beaverton, OR (July 30, 2004) NIKE, Inc. (NYSE: NKE) today filed its
fiscal year 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes an update to
its previously released futures information.

The company reported that current futures orders for footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2004 were 11.3
percent higher than the same period last year.  This growth was 60 basis
points higher than the 10.7 percent growth for the period reported in
Nike's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004 earnings press release dated
June 24, 2004.

The change versus what the company had previously reported is due to
increased orders primarily in its U.S. and Asia Pacific regions.  These
changes reflect orders taken in the normal course of business subsequent
to Nike's earnings announcement, which the company is obligated to
update in its Form 10-K filing.
