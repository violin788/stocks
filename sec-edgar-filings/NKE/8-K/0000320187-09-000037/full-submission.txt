today's call is Pamela Catlett, Vice President, Investor Relations. Before I
turn the call over to Ms. Catlett, let me remind you that participants of this
call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and
those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially.</font></div>

risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC,
including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern
future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues
for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate
fluctuations, order cancellations, and discounts which may vary significantly
from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s
business including equipment. Most of NIKE Retail, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan,
Converse, Hurley and Umbro are not included in these futures
numbers.</font></div>

participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of
comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations are found at NIKE's

statistical information, which is also publicly available on that site,

afternoon everybody. I see our third quarter as a snapshot of how to deliver
value in a volatile economy. Today's results have a lot of parts, but underlying
all of them are excellent operating results, driven by healthy revenue growth,
share gains for the NIKE brand and flexible and prudent business
management.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In tough
times having strong brands and sound business principles is just the beginning.
We have had the same simple and powerful strategy for years. Stay close to the
consumer, drive innovation into the marketplace, operate with excellence, and
manage with financial discipline.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Q3 proves
that NIKE can be opportunistic in the short-term and position the Company to
deliver consistent, long-term value to shareholders.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I feel
very good about our performance and our potential. It is good to be in the
business of sports, especially now when core values and passions gain so much
importance. And because we are the leader and the innovator in the business,
we're positioned to catalyze and expand growth.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It is not
enough to be a legacy player in today's global economy. A company's history is
not nearly as important as its potential. There is a new premium being defined
and it is based on trust, authenticity, innovation and a deep connection with
the consumer. These are the things that people value and the things that NIKE
delivers consistently.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Q3
illustrates more than our performance over the last three months, it shows how
we've managed the business and executed our growth strategy over the last three
years. We consistently leverage our portfolio to grow the market. We gain share,
outperform the industry, and position ourselves for long-term
growth.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">A big
part of that strategy is aimed at being a better, more responsive organization.
You have all asked yourself the question, can NIKE really cut costs and still
deliver growth?</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Last
quarter I told you we would take a flat plus approach to expenses. We did better
than that. We pushed down hard on headcount, travel and meeting costs and
tightened overall SG&amp;A. And we are seeing the results of that discipline.
But it is not just about cutting costs, if that is all you're doing, that is
nothing more than business as usual, and that won't win the day in this
environment. We're more ambitious than that.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we are
streamlining and realigning the entire organization on a global scale to target
growth and effectively manage expenses at the same time. We're making some tough
decisions, like a planned reduction in staff and moving to consolidate our
manufacturing base. They are tough decisions and they are smart decisions that
will better position the Company for sustained growth. As a result, we expect to
incur a restructuring charge of $175 million to $225 million, with the majority
of that charge occurring in Q4.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">If you're
wondering. does that mean NIKE is cutting back on innovation? I will be
perfectly clear, and that is absolutely not. We're not backing off. In fact, we
are accelerating our innovation agenda. When we invested in innovation to help
athletes in Beijing we knew those ideas would translate to consumers all over
the world, and they have.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I have
seen very clearly how our category offense builds strong businesses. Our brand
and products innovations are huge competitive advantages and absolutely
essential to our success. We are going to continue to leverage them to raise the
bar for ourselves and for the industry.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I want to
be clear that innovation isn't limited to the NIKE brand. It is the organizing
principle for the entire NIKE, Inc. portfolio. It drives product creation. It
defines how we manage every brand and how we connect with consumers. We use
innovation to build brand equity and integrity. That brings strength to each

afternoon everybody. The bottom line is the strength of the NIKE brand has never
been more obvious or more valuable. As Mark said, we are on the offense when it
comes to leveraging that strength. Q3 shows that when consumer confidence dips,
trust in authentic brands rise. And that is a solid foundation for growing the
business in a skittish economy.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

at our results on a constant dollar basis the NIKE brand generated revenue of
$3.8 billion, up 2%. Global Footwear was up 6% to a new Q3 revenue record of
$2.6 billion, with revenue gains in the US, China, Japan and the UK. Global
Apparel was down 4%. More about that in a minute.</font></div>

revenues are up in every region and across nearly every category, led by revenue
and marketshare gains in running, basketball, and sportswear. And by the way,
when we said there was potential for NIKE in action sports, it showed itself in
Q3. NIKE SB is now number one in core skate shops, and NIKE 6.0 was the
fastest-growing footwear brand in the action sports base.</font></div>

expand on something Mark mentioned about accelerating our innovation agenda. At
the top of that agenda is product. For the current season, spring '09, it is the
first time we have taken product that was created completely inside the new
category offense and delivered to the consumer. And consumers are responding.
Basketball and running, two of our largest global categories, are leading the
way.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Let's go
to basketball first. There's a lot of energy in this category right now. It is
hard to believe that just two years ago people were saying the business had
peaked. But we looked at it differently. We knew that the Gold Medal Game in
Beijing was an opportunity to use as a catalyst to re-energize basketball. And
that is what has happened.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I really
like where our basketball business is right now. First, we have really strong
product in the market and more on the way. The Kobe IV Low-Top, the Jordan True
Flight, the AJF6 are all performing extremely well.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Second,
we have identified -- we are identified with the best players in the game. Guys
like Kobe, LeBron, Carmelo, Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade are all leading the new
game, wearing NIKE, Jordan and Converse.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Third, we
are seeing consumers respond to an improved consumer experience at retail. We
are seeing it very dramatically at the House of Hoops stores, where revenue
increased double-digits in all three locations. And all of this contributed to
NIKE basketball being up double-digits, led by the Jordan brand.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Looking
forward, we are seeing double-digit futures growth in both NIKE basketball as
well as Brand Jordan. Basketball is back in a big way. March Madness starts
tomorrow with 52 teams in NIKE. That is the most ever. There's no doubt that the
basketball silhouette is reasserting its dominance. And with a 80% share and our
brands aligned like they are, we are ideally positioned to leverage that
energy.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The
running category continues to be a source of pure performance for the serious
runner. For example, our biggest performance running franchise, the Air Pegasus
25 is a great effort, combining performance and sustainability. And the Vomero+,
which is now the number one selling shoe at running specialty shops here in the
US. Basketball and running are great examples of doing what we do best, and that
is master the science of sport, and create energy around design and performance.
We did the same thing in Beijing. Some of you have asked me, NIKE invested a lot
of time and money in creating product for the Olympics. But do you really get
out of it?</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Here's
two quick examples, Flywire technology, which is migrating across categories,
brands and product types, as well as lightweight design. The best example being
the Hyperdunk, still one of the hottest selling basketball shoes in the
game.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As Mark
said, we are seeing our Beijing innovations resonate throughout our entire
product line. The Olympics have always been a great stage to innovate, and our
Spring '09 product line proves it. And yet the best is still to
come.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I said I
would touch on Apparel, where we are seeing focus and improvement. Again, we're
mastering the science of performance. Our Pro Combat product is a great example.
It is fundamentally changing the role of base layer apparel. You are going to
see Pro Combat on some of the best college basketball teams this tournament
season. You will see a lot more of it going forward as Pro Combat moves into
soccer and football. It is going to give athletes a competitive edge in the
games that they play. And it is going to give NIKE that same advantage in the
marketplace.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

said, we are also able to create energy around great design. The Eugene Track
Jacket has generated a lot of buzz in the world of sports culture, with its
iconic V for Victory design. The fact that it is popping up on marquee athletes
like Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Cristiano Ronaldo, proves its cross
category appeal. It is a great example of delivering the youthful and
competitive energy of sports through apparel.</font></div>

a lot about how we edit the business to amplify our growth. That is something we
are also doing on the product front, reducing the total number of SKUs to really
focus on the most innovative and high potential concepts across Footwear,
Apparel and Equipment.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I am very
pleased with the progress we're making here, especially in Apparel. Even though
sales are challenging, we're doing a good job managing down inventories and
elevating design to grow a healthier Apparel business. We're driving this
excellence and clarity across the entire product creation process, all the way
through to the retail floor.</font></div>

when we look back at this time in NIKE's history, we will see it as a period of
great change. The NIKE brand and consumers are moving into a new world and a new
relationship. The value equation transcends just price. We are seeing the rise
of new expectations based on quality, performance and sustainability in
products. And we are seeing consumers gravitate towards authentic brands that
work hard to earn their trust and keep it.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We are
also building a better and more responsive organization. As Mark said,
cost-cutting in today's environment is just business as usual. We're aiming a
lot higher. We're using our category offense as a dominant lens to review and
refine 100% of the NIKE brand's operations worldwide. We are still a growth
company, and we are positioning ourselves to be more competitive than
ever.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

we're done we will have a simpler, global organization, fewer layers, faster
decision-making, and a much more effective go to market process. We will be able
to get much closer to the consumer and to the market at every turn.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

moral of the story for Q3 is brand strength is a powerful asset in turbulent
times. The brand agility will be our competitive advantage for the long term. We
will be ready. Here is Don to take you through the numbers.</font></div>

increased 2%. Excluding currency changes, NIKE brand revenues grew 2%, while
revenues for our other businesses, which include Converse, Cole Haan, Hurley,

we expect Umbro's financial performance for fiscal 2009 to be slightly better
than previous guidance, projected future cash flows have fallen below the levels
we expected at the time of the acquisition. This erosion is a result of both the
unprecedented decline in global consumer markets, particularly in the UK, and
our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business.</font></div>

addition, financial market volatility has reduced both the estimated present
value of those future cash flows and the market value of comparable businesses.
While we continue to view Umbro as a vehicle for long-term growth within the

Umbro has declined.</font></div>

currency neutral basis NIKE brand footwear and apparel futures orders scheduled
for delivery from March through July 2009 declined 2%. Futures were lower in
comparison to a prior year that included orders related to the Beijing Olympics

financial management goals, delivering appropriate financial performance in

profitable growth over the long term. Our objective is to manage our business
exceptionally well today, and to take the opportunity to strengthen our Company
and improve our competitive position for tomorrow. To achieve those goals we're
taking action in four key areas. Number one, we maintaining our cautious
approach to planning revenues and buying inventory. Two, we're tightening our
supply chain to manage downside risk, maximize profitability, and position
ourselves for the future.</font></div>

expand on each of these a bit. First, planning revenues and inventory. We're
very encouraged by the strength of our brands around the world, but we're taking
a cautious view of the overall market and planning revenue to be roughly flat on
a currency neutral basis for the balance of fiscal 2009. Hence, we're buying
inventory tightly as we work with our retailers to keep inventories
healthy.</font></div>

we're tightening our supply chain. The reduction of worldwide demand for
consumer products is already having an impact on factories and workers in the
developing world. And our manufacturing partners are not immune. To maintain a
healthy manufacturing base for the present and the future, we're taking
proactive measures to consolidate production with our strongest, most efficient
and most innovative sourcing partners.</font></div>

capacity consolidation actions will require a significant amount of operational

future.</font></div>

are streamlining our management structure. We're looking at every aspect of our
cost structure to ensure we're investing resources against the highest potential
growth opportunities. Examples of the steps we have taken include maximizing the
impact of product creation resources by editing assortments and reducing styles.
Shifting demand creation investments from traditional media to higher impact
digital executions. Reducing T&amp;E and meeting expenses, and ramping up our
focus on procurement.</font></div>

performance on SG&amp;A cost management in the third quarter illustrates the
progress we're making. As we announced last month, we are also evaluating our
deployment of people. To enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly

reducing management layers and leveraging support services across our business
businesses globally. We expect to complete the majority of these changes by the
end of our current fiscal year.</font></div>

actions will be the key drivers of our expected results for the fourth quarter.
We expect currency neutral revenues for the fourth quarter to be roughly in line

expectations reflect comparisons to reported mid teens revenue growth last year

quarter gross margins will likely be well below prior year levels, driven by

fourth quarter.</font></div>

This is Charlie. Yes, let's just start with Europe. So Europe, challenging
environment. The most challenging markets are Spain or Iberia, Italy and France.
UK, we're holding our own. It is a tough marketplace, as we all know, but the
overall year-on-year business comparisons are relatively flat. And then actually
we are seeing some nice growth right now in Germany. And we feel good about the
brand's position going through and looking at Germany.</font></div>

think you'll probably start to see that more significantly as we move into
fiscal '10. You may recall that when oil was spiking in the spring and the early
summer of 2008, we're not seeing significant flow-through impact. We talked
about the delay at that point in our ability to negotiate with factories when
the oil price came down. We're going to see the benefit a little more slowly as
well. But we do definitely see improvements in oil prices coming in to our fall
and holiday seasons.</font></div>

the restructuring you alluded to on the call, Mark. And how it fits in with your
prior realignment you have announced with respect to focusing more on sport
categories. If you could help give us maybe a little bit more color on how
you're thinking about proceeding with that prospect.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

of all, a lot of this work that we have started with the restructuring goes back
to 2007, as you mentioned, with our focus on elevating the category dimension in
the organization, trying to make NIKE more consumer connected, more competitive
in each of the segments of our business. This work that we're in the middle of
right now is really following the same line of thinking.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First of
all, you have to recognize that our success and our potential is based primarily
on our ability to build our brand strength, innovative, compelling products and
experiences, really connecting more deeply with consumers. And the work we're
doing to reengineer the Company is focused on doing all those things
better.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So that
is really the driving force behind all this. So it is creating a more
responsive, more effective, more competitive, and again a more consumer focused
organization.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So as we
like to say, and it is absolutely the case, it is not just about cutting costs.
And as we all know, this is a period of time where it is not business as usual.
So it is about adapting and changing and evolving to be a better
company.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And I
think personally to allow the great talent we have here, the passion and the
competitive drive of the people here at NIKE to really realize its greatest
potential. So we're doing some things to streamline the organization, flatten
the organization and de-layer, in some cases minimize any redundancy in
positions. And really make NIKE a faster, more nimble, more efficient Company
overall. That really falls very much in line with the work that we started in
bringing more focus to the category dimension of the business.</font></div>

chain, and that process could last over 18 months. But a lot of the expense is
going to be running through the P&amp;L in the next quarter. Did I understand
that correctly?</font></div>

Actually, if you think about what we're doing on the factory basis, the impact
in terms of charges is going to be minimal. The cost, if any, will really be in
terms of how it flows through our logistics costs and margins.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

point we're working very hard with our sourcing partners to make this an orderly
transition. And we have planned this very carefully, but one of the things that
happens when you work through a process like this is that there will be some
uncertainty involved.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">But we
are very confident we have done the planning properly. And we're hopeful that
we're going to be able to make this minimally impactful with the business. But
this is not going to be an upfront charge issue. This is something that, if it
does happen, it would flow through margins.</font></div>

Saad&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Mark and Charlie, I wanted to ask you about the
concept of -- this concept that we might have been in a sports bubble the last
10 years. That people were so crazy about sports and corporations were chasing
dollars after being -- to be involved in sports. And landmark multibillion
dollar stadiums were being put up. And huge athlete contracts to play
professional sports. Now you're seeing stadiums with unsold seats. New stadiums
that can't sell the seats, and NBA franchises that are running into liquidity
issues.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

think -- how do you think about in this kind of new paradigm that we're in, the
role that sports plays in society. And how does it impact you from a cost and
marketing perspective, and then from a demand side? Do you see there being an
impact at the consumer level in how people view sports?</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font> First
of all, I think we remain very bullish on the power of sports and its role in
the economy, the interest of sports from a consumer standpoint. Some of the
assets that are in and around the world of sports might be changing or resetting
in terms of value in some cases. But overall the robust and interest in sports
and the commercial opportunities around it, we are as bullish about that now as
we have been, setting aside the recession that we're in right now.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

looking at just sports itself and its popularity and the consumer interest, and
the participation levels, we see that not is dwindling at all. If anything, we
are seeing more of an appetite for what we're doing. We're not seeing dramatic
decreases in average selling prices in our product. We're not seeing any real
falloff in terms of the opportunities we see in front of us.</font></div>

wouldn't say there has been a dramatic shift of late. If anything, I think the
interest in sports is strong and healthy. But again, I think you might be seeing
some of the assets in and around sports properties, event sponsorships and that
sort of thing, some of that value being reset in these times.</font></div>

would just jump in on a couple of things. It is an interesting idea, sports
bubble, that you mentioned. But I think when you think -- you mentioned a couple
of things. Attendance may be down in some cases, but I think viewership is
actually up. I think that is something that you have to think about a little
bit.</font></div>
      <div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br></div>

about traditional access to events, which has been a metric that most people use
versus really what may be a new access is, which is more like immersion. We are
seeing kids online for anywhere from 20 minutes to two to three hours as they
immerse themselves in the new access points to sports, whether it is through the
athletes, through communities that are talking about it. And it is 24 hours a
day. That has changed incredibly.</font></div>

the other thing that you think about too is the traditional sports, the stick
and ball sports versus the new action sports, and the different communities and
environments that are being created around some of these. And some of things
that we have talked about as we build our brand in some of these new
areas.</font></div>

is all about a focused effort around each one of these sports and their
communities. I think we have talked a lot about that consumer experience and how
we continue to build the brand and reinvent the brand, connecting with these
kids.</font></div>

the bubble may not be as much a bubble. Maybe if you are in the old and not

second question would be on the futures window. When you look at the futures you
guys put out today, the sort of three-month forward versus the six-month
forward, so that when you look at the fiscal first quarter and you come up

really big in futures in the forward three-month period?</font></div>

NIKE, Inc. direct-to-customer business is another big step in that direction. It
is another big commitment that we're making to that competency for NIKE. Across
the portfolio, not just within the NIKE brand. And certainly physical stores, as

objective from the restructuring to keep SG&amp;A flat. How did you pick flat?

we put a set of financial guard rails around the process, our main focus was

the things that I expect the pattern for the fourth quarter is going to be the

back in the other income and expense line. Whenever you have that sort of
pattern on the currencies, you are going to see other income and expense perform
as it did in the third quarter.</font></div>

That's helpful. Then I guess maybe if you can just talk about on the US futures
position; it is declining sequentially. I guess I was kind of curious. Is that
just because of retailers maybe just working down inventory levels, being more
cautious as they went through January and closed out their fiscal
year?</font></div>

it seems like we are seeing -- at least, we are seeing very significant growth
in your Footwear business in the US, as we have gone through February. I was

This is Charlie. Right now most of the retailers close their fiscal year ends
out either calendar year or January. And so some of that softness that you
mentioned is correct. I think at retail our sell-throughs continue to be very
strong. And we felt great about our performance in February. And right now I'm
certainly not going to sit in the position where I'm going to start predicting
the future in these conditions.</font></div>

that, we're very -- we feel very good about our brand strength. We do seem to
always be somewhat of a safe haven in turbulent times. And that seems to be

inventory through your outlet business.</font></div>

look to China, I am just kind of curious, given what is going on there and kind
of trying to move and flow inventory, can you just talk about the opportunities
to maybe improve how you are operating and moving product in China? I believe
you are opening up a new facility sometime in the next year or so to improve
fulfillment. So it looks like there's an opportunity. So I was wondering if you

prosperity here. We're going to be investing where we think, as Don said, the
return is the greatest.</font></div>

Understood. That is very helpful. Then on the gross margin side, any sense of
the magnitude of impact of markdowns versus currency? And then does currency
impact the inventory number on the balance sheet?</font></div>

sorry, so the first question is on the gross margin expectation. Magnitude of
the hit from currency versus markdowns, is one bigger than the other in the
fourth quarter?</font></div>

both of those will be key drivers of the margin. I can't tell you what the exact
proportion is, but certainly from a currency standpoint, the hedging program we
have has been very, very helpful for us over the last three or four quarters.
We're going to see a little more flow-through in the fourth quarter of that
dollar strength.</font></div>

it does affect the value of the inventory on the balance sheet, both in terms of
when you buy it. It turns into, for example, more pesos. And then when you
translate it back into dollars there's another piece of delta. That is why
inventory, as we say to you, when we look at it on a unit basis and we look at
it country by country and category by category, we feel very good about where
our inventory is right now.</font></div>
