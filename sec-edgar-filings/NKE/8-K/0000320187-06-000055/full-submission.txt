       NIKE, INC. REPORTS FISCAL 2006 EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH OF 18 PERCENT

           Revenue up 9 percent to $15.0 billion for the year; worldwide
                            futures orders up 5 percent


BEAVERTON, Ore. (27 June, 2006) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
financial results for the 2006 fiscal year, ended May 31, 2006. For the
fiscal year, revenues grew 9 percent to $15.0 billion, compared to $13.7
billion last year. Net income increased 15 percent to $1.4 billion,
compared to $1.2 billion last year, and diluted earnings per share
increased 18 percent to $5.28 versus $4.48 last year. For the fourth
quarter, revenues increased 8 percent to $4.0 billion, compared to $3.7
billion for the same period last year. Fourth quarter net income declined 5
percent to $332.8 million, compared to $349.5 million in the prior year,
and diluted earnings per share declined 2 percent to $1.27, versus $1.30
last year. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1
percentage point for the full year, and 2 percentage points for the fourth
quarter.

A previously disclosed one-time charge for the Converse arbitration ruling
reduced fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by $0.12. Excluding the
charge, fourth quarter net income increased 4 percent and diluted earnings
per share increased 7 percent to $1.39. For the full year, excluding the
charge, earnings per share were $5.39, up 20 percent compared to last year.

Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "With
deeper focus on discrete segments of our business, strong connections with
consumers through global initiatives such as Joga Bonito, and compelling
product innovations such as Air Max 360, we delivered very strong earnings
growth and record revenues for the year. The Nike brand has never been
stronger. We deepened our brand leadership in core categories such as
basketball and soccer, and experienced strong growth in key markets such as
the United States, Latin America, China and Russia. Our broader brand
portfolio also performed well, with stellar performances for the year from
Brand Jordan, Nike Golf and Converse."

"As we drive top-line results and extend our brand leadership," Parker
continued, "we also remain committed to creating value for shareholders.
Our management focus on operating expense leverage is playing an
increasingly important role in delivering our long-term financial goals and
we continue to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders through
increased share repurchases and a rising dividend payout ratio."

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from June 2006 through November 2006,
totaling $6.6 billion, 5 percent higher than such orders reported for the

significant impact on this growth.*

includes the Middle East and Africa) increased 1 percent; Asia Pacific grew
10 percent; and the Americas decreased 1 percent. Changes in currency
exchange rates did not have a material effect on reported futures orders in

region, changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported futures
orders by 3 percentage points.*

10-K. Some forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in
