Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation
           under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.


     On January 24, 2007, NIKE, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a new
commercial paper program (the "Program") under which the Company may
issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "Notes") up to a maximum
amount outstanding at any time of $1.0 billion.  The Program replaces the
Company's existing $750 million commercial paper program, under which
there are currently no notes outstanding.  Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill
Lynch Money Market, Inc., and Wells Fargo Institutional Securities, LLC
will act as dealers under the Program.  The Notes may have maturities
ranging up to 364 days.  Amounts available under the Program may be
reborrowed.  The Program contains no restrictive financial or other
covenants.
