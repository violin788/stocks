Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
____________________________________________________

     Amendment of Executive Performance Sharing Plan
     _______________________________________________

     On June 16, 2005, the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (the "Company")
approved amendments, as described below, to the Company's Executive
Performance Sharing Plan (the "Plan"), subject to the approval by the
Company's shareholders of the amendments at the Company's 2005 annual meeting
of shareholders held on September 20, 2005 (the "2005 Annual Meeting").   The
Plan provides that it will terminate at the first shareholder meeting that
occurs in the fifth fiscal year after the Company's shareholders last approved
the Plan.  Accordingly, shareholder re-approval of the Plan at the 2005 Annual
Meeting was required to extend the Plan for an additional five years until the
fiscal 2011 annual meeting of shareholders.  The amendments and the re-
approval were approved by the requisite vote of the Company's shareholders at
the 2005 Annual Meeting and became effective as of September 20, 2005.

     Under the Plan amendments, the per-employee limit on annual bonuses under
the Plan was increased from (a) the lesser of 150% of base salary or $2
million to (b) the lesser of 200% of base salary or $5 million.  A copy of the
Plan, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

     Amendment of 1990 Stock Incentive Plan
     ______________________________________

     On June 16, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved
amendments, as described below, to the Company's 1990 Stock Incentive Plan
(the "1990 Plan"), subject to the approval by the Company's shareholders of
the amendments at the 2005 Annual Meeting.   The amendments were approved by
the requisite vote of the Company's shareholders at the 2005 Annual Meeting
and became effective as of September 20, 2005.

     Under the 1990 Plan amendments, an additional 16,000,000 shares of Class
B Common Stock was reserved for issuance under the 1990 Plan, thereby
increasing the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1990
Plan from 50,000,000 to 66,000,000 shares.  Also under the 1990 Plan
amendments, the per-employee limit on grants of options and stock appreciation
rights under the 1990 Plan was increased from 200,000 shares to 400,000 shares
annually.  A copy of the 1990 Plan, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 10.2
hereto.

                 Executive Performance Sharing Plan
       (Approved by shareholders September 1995, 2000 and 2005)


       This is the Executive Performance Sharing Plan of NIKE, Inc. for
the payment of incentive compensation to designated employees.

       Section 1.  Definitions.  The following terms have the following
                                 meanings:

       Code:  The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

       Committee:  The Personnel Committee of the Board, provided
       however, if the Personnel Committee of the Board is not composed
       entirely of Outside Directors, the "Committee" shall mean a
       committee composed entirely of at least two Outside Directors
       appointed by the Board from time to time.

       Company:  NIKE, Inc.

       Exchange Act:  The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

       Outside Directors:  The meaning ascribed to this term in Section
       162(m) of the Code and the regulations proposed or adopted
       thereunder.

       Performance Target:  An objectively determinable level of
       performance as selected by the Committee to measure performance
       of the Company or any subsidiary, division, or other unit of the
       Company for the Year based on one or more of the following: net
       income, net income before taxes, operating income, revenues,
       return on sales, return on equity, earnings per share, total
       shareholder return, or any of the foregoing before the effect of
       acquisitions, divestitures, accounting changes, restructuring, or
       other special charges, as determined by the Committee at the time
       of establishing a Performance Target.

       Plan:  The Executive Performance Sharing Plan of the Company.

       Target Award:  An amount of cash compensation to be paid to a
       Plan participant based on achievement of a particular Performance
       Target level established by the Committee, expressed as a
       percentage of the participant's base salary at the beginning of
       the Year, determined in accordance with guidelines established by
       the Committee.

       Year:  The fiscal year of the Company.

       Section 2.  Objectives.  The objectives of the Plan are to:

      (a)     recognize and reward on an annual basis the Company's
corporate officers for their contributions to the overall profitability
and performance of the Company; and

      (b)     qualify compensation under the Plan as "performance based
compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

      Section 3.  Administration.  The Plan will be administered by the
Committee.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee will
have full authority to interpret the Plan, to establish and amend rules
and regulations relating to it, to determine the terms and provisions
for making awards and to make all other determinations necessary or
advisable for the administration of the Plan.

      Section 4.  Participation.  Participation in the Plan shall be
limited to individuals who are corporate officers of the Company.

      Section 5.  Determination of the Performance Targets and Awards.
The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the Performance
Targets and Target Award opportunities for each participant, within 90
days of the beginning of each Year.  The Committee may establish (i)
several Performance Target levels for each participant, each
corresponding to a different Target Award opportunity, and (ii)
different Performance Targets and Target Award opportunities for each
participant in the Plan.  The maximum Target Award opportunity under the
Plan for a participant in any Year shall be the lesser of 200% of the
participant's base salary established at the beginning of the Year, or
$5 million.  For competitive reasons, the specific Performance Targets
determined by the Committee will not be publicly disclosed.

      Section 6.  Determination of Plan Awards.  At the conclusion of
the Year, in accordance with Section 162(m)(4)(C)(iii) of the Code,
prior to the payment of any award under the Plan, the Committee shall
certify in the Committee's internal meeting minutes the attainment of
the Performance Targets for the Year and the calculation of the awards.
No award shall be paid if the related Performance Target is not met.  In
no event shall an award to any participant exceed the lesser of 150% of
the participant's base salary, or $2 million.  The Committee may, in its
sole discretion, reduce or eliminate any participant's calculated award
based on circumstances relating to the performance of the Company or the
participant.  Awards will be paid in cash as soon as practicable
following the Committee's certification of the awards.

      Section 7.  Termination of Employment.  The terms of a Target
Award may provide that in the event of a participant's termination of
employment for any reason during a Year, the participant (or his or her
beneficiary) will receive, at the time provided in Section 6, all or any
portion of the award to which the participant would otherwise have been
entitled.

      Section 8.  Miscellaneous.

      (a)     Amendment and Termination of the Plan.  The Committee with
the approval of the Board may amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any
time and from time to time except insofar as approval by the Company's
shareholders is required pursuant to Section 162(m)(4)(C)(ii) of the
Code.  The Plan shall terminate at the first shareholder meeting that
occurs in the fifth Year after the Company's shareholders approve the
Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment, modification or
termination shall affect the payment of Target Awards previously
established.

      (b)     No Assignment.  Except as otherwise required by applicable
law, no interest, benefit, payment, claim or right of any participant
under the plan shall be subject in any manner to any claims of any
creditor of any participant or beneficiary, nor to alienation by
anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment, bankruptcy, pledge,
attachment, charge or encumbrance of any kind, and any attempt to take
any such action shall be null and void.

      (c)     No Rights to Employment.  Nothing contained in the Plan
shall give any person the right to be retained in the employment of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.  The Company reserves the right to
terminate a participant at any time for any reason notwithstanding the
existence of the Plan.

      (d)     Beneficiary Designation.  The Committee shall establish
such procedures as it deems necessary for a participant to designate a
beneficiary to whom any amounts would be payable in the event of a
participant's death.

      (e)     Plan Unfunded.   The entire cost of the Plan shall be paid
from the general assets of the Company.  The rights of any person to
receive benefits under the Plan shall be only those of a general
unsecured creditor, and neither the Company nor the Board nor the
Committee shall be responsible for the adequacy of the general assets of
the Company to meet and discharge Plan liabilities, nor shall the
Company be required to reserve or otherwise set aside funds for the
payment of its obligations hereunder.

      (f)     Applicable Law.  The Plan and all rights thereunder shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Oregon.

EXHIBIT 10.2

                          NIKE, Inc.
                  1990 Stock Incentive Plan

     1.    Purpose.    The purpose of this Stock Incentive Plan (the
           _______
"Plan") is to enable NIKE, Inc. (the "Company") to attract and retain as
directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and independent
contractors people of initiative and ability and to provide additional
incentives to such persons.

     2.    Shares Subject to the Plan.    Subject to adjustment as
           __________________________
provided below and in paragraph 10, the shares to be offered under the
Plan shall consist of Class B Common Stock of the Company ("Shares"),
and the total number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan shall
not exceed  sixty-six million (66,000,000) Shares. If an option or stock
appreciation right granted under the Plan expires, terminates or is
canceled, the unissued Shares subject to such option or stock
appreciation right shall again be available under the Plan. If Shares
sold or awarded as a bonus under the Plan are forfeited to the Company
or repurchased by the Company, the number of Shares forfeited or
repurchased shall again be available under the Plan.

     3.    Effective Date and Duration of Plan.
           ___________________________________

     (a)    Effective Date.    The Plan shall become effective when
            ______________
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company. However, no option or
stock appreciation right granted under the Plan shall become exercisable
until the Plan is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Common Stock of the Company represented at a
shareholders meeting at which a quorum is present and any awards under
the Plan prior to such approval shall be conditioned on and subject to
such approval. Subject to this limitation, options and stock
appreciation rights may be granted and Shares may be awarded as bonuses
or sold under the Plan at any time after the effective date and before
termination of the Plan.


     (b)    Duration.    The Plan shall continue in effect until all
            ________
Shares available for issuance under the Plan have been issued and all
restrictions on such Shares have lapsed. The Board of Directors may
suspend or terminate the Plan at any time except with respect to options
and Shares subject to restrictions then outstanding under the Plan.
Termination shall not affect any outstanding options, any right of the
Company to repurchase Shares or the forfeitability of Shares issued
under the Plan.

     4.    Administration.
           ______________

     The Plan shall be administered by a committee appointed by the
Board of Directors of the Company consisting of not less than two
directors (the "Committee"), which shall determine and designate from
time to time the individuals to whom awards shall be made, the amount of
the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards, except that
only the Board of Directors may amend or terminate the Plan as provided
in paragraphs 3 and 13. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the
Committee may from time to time adopt and amend rules and regulations
relating to administration of the Plan, advance the lapse of any waiting
period, accelerate any exercise date, waive or modify any restriction
applicable to Shares (except those restrictions imposed by law) and make
all other determinations in the judgment of the Committee necessary or
desirable for the administration of the Plan. The interpretation and
construction of the provisions of the Plan and related agreements by the
Committee shall be final and conclusive. The Committee may correct any
defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan
or in any related agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall
deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole
and final judge of such expediency. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Paragraph 4, the Board of Directors may
delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, as a one-
member committee of the Board of Directors, the authority to grant
awards with respect to a maximum of 50,000 Shares to any eligible
employee who is not, at the time of such grant, subject to the reporting
requirements and liability provisions contained in Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the regulations
thereunder.

     5.    Types of Awards; Eligibility.    The Committee may, from time
           ____________________________
to time, take the following action, separately or in combination, under
the Plan: (i) grant Incentive Stock Options, as defined in Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as
provided in paragraph 6(b); (ii) grant options other than Incentive
Stock Options ("Non-Statutory Stock Options") as provided in paragraph
6(c); (iii) award stock bonuses as provided in paragraph 7; (iv) sell
shares subject to restrictions as provided in paragraph 8; and (v) grant
stock appreciation rights as provided in paragraph 9. Any such awards
may be made to employees, including employees who are officers or
directors, of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the
Company and to other individuals described in paragraph 1 who the
Committee believes have made or will make an important contribution to
the Company or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that only employees
of the Company shall be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options
under the Plan. The Committee shall select the individuals to whom
awards shall be made. The Committee shall specify the action taken with
respect to each individual to whom an award is made under the Plan. No
employee may be granted options or stock appreciation rights under the
Plan for more than 400,000 Shares in any calendar year.

     6.    Option Grants.
           _____________

     (a)    Grant.    The Committee may grant options under the Plan.
            _____
With respect to each option grant, the Committee shall determine the
number of Shares subject to the option, the option price, the period of
the option, the time or times at which the option may be exercised and
whether the option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock
Option.

     (b)    Incentive Stock Options.  Incentive Stock Options shall be
            _______________________
subject to the following terms and conditions:

           (i)    An Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the
      Plan to an employee possessing more than 10 percent of the total
      combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of
      any parent or subsidiary of the Company only if the option price
      is at least 110 percent of the fair market value of the Shares
      subject to the option on the date it is granted, as described in
      paragraph 6(b)(iii), and the option by its terms is not
      exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is
      granted.

          (ii)   Subject to paragraphs 6(b)(i) and 6(d), Incentive
      Stock Options granted under the Plan shall continue in effect for
      the period fixed by the Committee, except that no Incentive Stock
      Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from
      the date it is granted.

          (iii)   The option price per share shall be determined by the
      Committee at the time of grant. Subject to paragraph 6(b)(i), the
      option price shall not be less than 100 percent of the fair market
      value of the Shares covered by the Incentive Stock Option at the
      date the option is granted. The fair market value shall be deemed
      to be the closing price of the Class B Common Stock of the Company
      as reported in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
      in the Wall Street Journal on the day preceding the date the
      option is granted, or if there has been no sale on that date, on
      the last preceding date on which a sale occurred, or such other
      reported value of the Class B Common Stock of the Company as shall
      be specified by the Committee.

          (iv)   No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted on or after
      the tenth anniversary of the last action by the Board of Directors
      approving an increase in the number of shares available for
      issuance under the Plan, which action was subsequently approved
      within 12 months by the shareholders.

     (c)    Non-Statutory Stock Options.    The option price for Non-
            ___________________________
Statutory Stock Options shall be determined by the Committee at the time
of grant. The option price may not be less than 75 percent of the fair
market value of the Shares covered by the Non-Statutory Stock Option on
the date the option is granted. The fair market value of Shares covered
by a Non-Statutory Stock Option shall be determined pursuant to
paragraph 6(b)(iii).

     (d)    Exercise of Options.    Except as provided in paragraph
            ___________________
6(f), no option granted under the Plan may be exercised unless at the
time of such exercise the optionee is employed by the Company or any
parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company and shall have been so
employed continuously since the date such option was granted. Absence on
leave or on account of illness or disability under rules established by
the Committee shall not, however, be deemed an interruption of
employment for this purpose. Except as provided in paragraphs 6(f), 10
and 11, options granted under the Plan may be exercised from time to
time over the period stated in each option in such amounts and at such
times as shall be prescribed by the Committee, provided that options
shall not be exercised for fractional shares. Unless otherwise
determined by the Committee, if the optionee does not exercise an option
in any one year with respect to the full number of Shares to which the
optionee is entitled in that year, the optionee's rights shall be
cumulative and the optionee may purchase those Shares in any subsequent
year during the term of the option.

     (e)    Nontransferability.    Except as provided below, each stock
            __________________
option granted under the Plan by its terms shall be nonassignable and
nontransferable by the optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of
law, and each option by its terms shall be exercisable during the
optionee's lifetime only by the optionee. A stock option may be
transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the
state or country of the optionee's domicile at the time of death. A Non-
Statutory Stock Option shall also be transferable pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined under the Code or Title I
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Committee may, in
its discretion, authorize all or a portion of a Non-Statutory Stock
Option granted to an optionee to be on terms which permit transfer by
the optionee to (i) the spouse, children or grandchildren of the
optionee ("Immediate Family Members"), (ii) a trust or trusts for the
exclusive benefit of Immediate Family Members, or (iii) a partnership in
which Immediate Family Members are the only partners, provided that (x)
there may be no consideration for any transfer, (y) the stock option
agreement pursuant to which the options are granted must expressly
provide for transferability in a manner consistent with this paragraph,
and (z) subsequent transfers of transferred options shall be prohibited
except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Following any
transfer, options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer, provided
that for purposes of paragraphs 6(d), 6(g), 10 and 11 the term
"optionee" shall be deemed to refer to the transferee. The events of
termination of employment of paragraph 6(f), shall continue to be
applied with respect to the original optionee, following which the
options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and
for the periods specified, and all other references to employment,
termination of employment, life or death of the optionee, shall continue
to be applied with respect to the original optionee.

     (f)    Termination of Employment or Death.
            __________________________________

          (i)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in the
     event the employment of the optionee by the Company or a parent or
     subsidiary corporation of the Company terminates for any reason
     other than because of retirement, physical disability or death, the
     option may be exercised at any time prior to the expiration date of
     the option or the expiration of three months after the date of such
     termination of employment, whichever is the shorter period, but
     only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the
     option at the date of such termination.

          (ii)   Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in the
     event the employment of the optionee by the Company or a parent or
     subsidiary corporation of the Company terminates as a result of the
     optionee's retirement, the option may be exercised by the optionee
     to the extent specified in this paragraph 6(f)(ii) at any time
     prior to the expiration date of the option or the expiration of
     three months after the date of such termination of employment,
     whichever is the shorter period. For purposes of this paragraph
     6(f), "retirement" means a termination of employment that occurs at
     a time when (A) the optionee's retirement point total is at least
     55, and (B) the optionee has at least five full years of service as
     an employee of the Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation of
     the Company. For purposes of this paragraph 6(f), "retirement point
     total" means the sum of the optionee's age in full years plus the
     optionee's full years of service as an employee of the Company or a
     parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company. Upon retirement,
     the optionee may exercise the portion of the option that the
     optionee was entitled to exercise immediately prior to retirement
     plus a percentage of the remaining unvested portion of the option
     based on the optionee's retirement point total at the time of
     retirement as set forth in the following table:

                                         Percent of Unvested Option
          Retirement Point Total          That Becomes Exercisable
          ______________________         __________________________
                 55 or 56                            20%
                    57                               40%
                    58                               60%
                    59                               80%
                    60                              100%

          (iii)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in
     the event the employment of the optionee by the Company or a parent
     or subsidiary corporation of the Company terminates because the
     optionee becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3)
     of the Code), the option may be exercised by the optionee free of
     the limitations on the amount that may be purchased in any one year
     specified in the option agreement at any time prior to the
     expiration date of the option or the expiration of one year after
     the date of such termination, whichever is the shorter period.

          (iv)    Unless otherwise provided at the time of grant, in the
     event of the death of the optionee while in the employ of the
     Company or a parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company, the
     option may be exercised free of the limitations on the amount that
     may be purchased in any one year specified in the option agreement
     at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or the
     expiration of one year after the date of such death, whichever is
     the shorter period, but only by the person or persons to whom such
     optionee's rights under the option shall pass by the optionee's
     will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or
     country of domicile at the time of death.

          (v)    The Committee, at the time of grant or at any time
     thereafter, may extend the three-month and one-year expiration
     periods any length of time not later than the original expiration
     date of the option, and may increase the portion of an option that
     is exercisable, subject to such terms and conditions as the
     Committee may determine.

          (vi)    To the extent that the option of any deceased optionee
     or of any optionee whose employment terminates is not exercised
     within the applicable period, all further rights to purchase Shares
     pursuant to such option shall cease and terminate.

     (g)    Purchase of Shares.    Unless the Committee determines
            __________________
otherwise, Shares may be acquired pursuant to an option granted under
the Plan only upon receipt by the Company of notice in writing from the
optionee of the optionee's intention to exercise, specifying the number
of Shares as to which the optionee desires to exercise the option and
the date on which the optionee desires to complete the transaction, and
if required in order to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, containing a representation that it is the optionee's present
intention to acquire the Shares for investment and not with a view to
distribution. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, on or before
the date specified for completion of the purchase of Shares pursuant to
an option, the optionee must have paid the Company the full purchase
price of such Shares in cash or with the consent of the Committee, in
whole or in part, in Common Stock of the Company valued at fair market
value. The fair market value of Common Stock of the Company provided in
payment of the purchase price shall be the closing price of the Common
Stock of the Company as reported in the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Transactions in the Wall Street Journal or such other reported
value of the Common Stock of the Company as shall be specified by the
Committee, on the date the option is exercised, or if such date is not a
trading day, then on the immediately preceding trading day. No Shares
shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. With the
consent of the Committee, an optionee may request the Company to apply
automatically the Shares to be received upon the exercise of a portion
of a stock option (even though stock certificates have not yet been
issued) to satisfy the purchase price for additional portions of the
option. Each optionee who has exercised an option shall immediately upon
notification of the amount due, if any, pay to the Company in cash
amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax
withholding requirements. If additional withholding is or becomes
required beyond any amount deposited before delivery of the
certificates, the optionee shall pay such amount to the Company on
demand. If the optionee fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company
may withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to
the optionee, including salary, subject to applicable law. With the
consent of the Committee, an optionee may satisfy this obligation, in
whole or in part, by having the Company withhold from the Shares to be
issued upon the exercise that number of Shares that would satisfy the
withholding amount due or by delivering Common Stock of the Company to
the Company to satisfy the withholding amount. Upon the exercise of an
option, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall
be reduced by the number of Shares issued upon exercise of the option.

     7.    Stock Bonuses.    The Committee may award Shares under the
           _____________
Plan as stock bonuses. Shares awarded as a stock bonus shall be subject
to the terms, conditions, and restrictions determined by the Committee.
The restrictions may include restrictions concerning transferability and
forfeiture of the Shares awarded, together with such other restrictions
as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may require the
recipient to sign an agreement as a condition of the award, but may not
require the recipient to pay any monetary consideration other than
amounts necessary to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The agreement
may contain any terms, conditions, restrictions, representations and
warranties required by the Committee. The certificates representing the
Shares awarded shall bear any legends required by the Committee. The
Company may require any recipient of a stock bonus to pay to the Company
in cash upon demand amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal,
state or local tax withholding requirements. If the recipient fails to
pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold that amount from other
amounts payable by the Company to the recipient, including salary,
subject to applicable law. With the consent of the Committee, a
recipient may deliver Common Stock of the Company to the Company to
satisfy this withholding obligation. Upon the issuance of a stock bonus,
the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be
reduced by the number of Shares issued.

     8.    Restricted Stock.    The Committee may issue Shares under the
           ________________
Plan for such consideration (including promissory notes and services) as
determined by the Committee, provided that in no event shall the
consideration be less than 75 percent of fair market value of the Shares
at the time of issuance. Shares issued under the Plan shall be subject
to the terms, conditions and restrictions determined by the Committee.
The restrictions may include restrictions concerning transferability,
repurchase by the Company and forfeiture of the Shares issued, together
with such other restrictions as may be determined by the Committee. All
Shares issued pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall be subject to a
purchase agreement, which shall be executed by the Company and the
prospective recipient of the Shares prior to the delivery of
certificates representing such Shares to the recipient. The purchase
agreement may contain any terms, conditions, restrictions,
representations and warranties required by the Committee. The
certificates representing the Shares shall bear any legends required by
the Committee. The Company may require any purchaser of restricted stock
to pay to the Company in cash upon demand amounts necessary to satisfy
any applicable federal, state or local tax withholding requirements. If
the purchaser fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may withhold
that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to the purchaser,
including salary, subject to applicable law. With the consent of the
Committee, a purchaser may deliver Common Stock of the Company to the
Company to satisfy this withholding obligation. Upon the issuance of
restricted stock, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the
Plan shall be reduced by the number of Shares issued.

     9.    Stock Appreciation Rights.
           _________________________

    (a)    Grant.    Stock appreciation rights may be granted under the
           _____
Plan by the Committee, subject to such rules, terms, and conditions as
the Committee prescribes.

     (b)    Exercise.
            ________

          (i)    A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable only at
     the time or times established by the Committee. If a stock
     appreciation right is granted in connection with an option, the
     stock appreciation right shall be exercisable only to the extent
     and on the same conditions that the related option could be
     exercised. Upon exercise of a stock appreciation right, any option
     or portion thereof to which the stock appreciation right relates
     terminates. If a stock appreciation right is granted in connection
     with an option, upon exercise of the option, the stock appreciation
     right or portion thereof to which the option relates terminates.

          (ii)    The Committee may withdraw any stock appreciation
     right granted under the Plan at any time and may impose any
     conditions upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or adopt
     rules and regulations from time to time affecting the rights of
     holders of stock appreciation rights. Such rules and regulations
     may govern the right to exercise stock appreciation rights granted
     before adoption or amendment of such rules and regulations as well
     as stock appreciation rights granted thereafter.

          (iii)    Each stock appreciation right shall entitle the
     holder, upon exercise, to receive from the Company in exchange
     therefor an amount equal in value to the excess of the fair market
     value on the date of exercise of one share of Class B Common Stock
     of the Company over its fair market value on the date of grant (or,
     in the case of a stock appreciation right granted in connection
     with an option, the option price per Share under the option to
     which the stock appreciation right relates), multiplied by the
     number of Shares covered by the stock appreciation right or the
     option, or portion thereof, that is surrendered. Payment by the
     Company upon exercise of a stock appreciation right may be made in
     Shares valued at fair market value, in cash, or partly in Shares
     and partly in cash, all as determined by the Committee.

          (iv)    For purposes of this paragraph 9, the fair market
     value of the Class B Common Stock of the Company on the date a
     stock appreciation right is exercised shall be the closing price of
     the Class B Common Stock of the Company as reported in the New York
     Stock Exchange Composite Transactions in the Wall Street Journal,
     or such other reported value of the Class B Common Stock of the
     Company as shall be specified by the Committee, on the date the
     stock appreciation right is exercised, or if such date is not a
     trading day, then on the immediately preceding trading day.

          (v)    No fractional shares shall be issued upon exercise of a
     stock appreciation right. In lieu thereof, cash shall be paid in an
     amount equal to the value of the fractional share.

          (vi)    Each stock appreciation right granted under the Plan
     by its terms shall be nonassignable and nontransferable by the
     holder, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will
     or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or county
     of the holder's domicile at the time of death, and each stock
     appreciation right by its terms shall be exercisable during the
     holder's lifetime only by the holder; provided, however, that a
     stock appreciation right not granted in connection with an
     Incentive Stock Option shall also be transferable pursuant to a
     qualified domestic relations order as defined under the Code or
     Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

          (vii)    Each participant who has exercised a stock
     appreciation right shall, upon notification of the amount due, pay
     to the Company in cash amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable
     federal, state or local tax withholding requirements. If the
     participant fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company may
     withhold that amount from other amounts payable by the Company to
     the participant including salary, subject to applicable law. With
     the consent of the Committee a participant may satisfy this
     obligation, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold
     from any Shares to be issued upon the exercise that number of
     Shares that would satisfy the withholding amount due or by
     delivering Common Stock of the Company to the Company to satisfy
     the withholding amount.

          (viii)    Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right for
     Shares, the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan
     shall be reduced by the number of Shares issued. Cash payments of
     stock appreciation rights shall not reduce the number of Shares
     reserved for issuance under the Plan.

     10.    Changes in Capital Structure.    If the outstanding shares
            ____________________________
of Common Stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
other securities of the Company or of another corporation by reason of
any reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of exchange,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, combination of
shares or dividend payable in shares, appropriate adjustment shall be
made by the Committee in the number and kind of shares available for
awards under the Plan, provided that this paragraph 10 shall not apply
with respect to transactions referred to in paragraph 11. In addition,
the Committee shall make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind
of shares as to which outstanding options and stock appreciation rights,
or portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end
that the optionee's proportionate interest is maintained as before the
occurrence of such event. The Committee may also require that any
securities issued in respect of or exchanged for Shares issued hereunder
that are subject to restrictions be subject to similar restrictions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have no obligation to
effect any adjustment that would or might result in the issuance of
fractional shares, and any fractional shares resulting from any
adjustment may be disregarded or provided for in any manner determined
by the Committee. Any such adjustments made by the Committee shall be
conclusive. In the event of a merger, consolidation or plan of exchange
affecting the Company to which paragraph 11 does not apply, in lieu of
providing for options and stock appreciation rights as provided above in
this paragraph 10, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a
30-day period prior to such event during which optionees shall have the
right to exercise options and stock appreciation rights in whole or in
part without any limitation on exercisability and upon the expiration of
such 30-day period all unexercised options and stock appreciation rights
shall immediately terminate.

     11.    Special Acceleration in Certain Events.
            ______________________________________

     (a)    Special Acceleration.    Notwithstanding any other
            ____________________
provisions of the Plan, a special acceleration ("Special Acceleration")
of options and stock appreciation rights outstanding under the Plan
shall occur with the effect set forth in paragraph 11(b) at any time
when the shareholders of the Company approve one of the following
("Approved Transactions"):

           (i)    Any consolidation, merger, plan of exchange, or
     transaction involving the Company ("Merger") in which the Company
     is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which
     the Common Stock of the Company would be converted into cash,
     securities or other property, other than a Merger involving the
     Company in which the holders of the Common Stock of the Company
     immediately prior to the Merger have the same proportionate
     ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation after the
     Merger; or

           (ii)    Any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one
     transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or
     substantially all of the assets of the Company or the adoption of
     any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the
     Company.

     (b)    Effect on Outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
            ___________________________________________________________
Except as provided below in this paragraph 11(b), upon a Special
Acceleration pursuant to paragraph 11(a), all options and stock
appreciation rights then outstanding under the Plan shall immediately
become exercisable in full during the remainder of their terms;
provided, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a 30-day
period prior to an Approved Transaction during which optionees shall
have the right to exercise options and stock appreciation rights, in
whole or in part, without any limitation on exercisability, and upon the
expiration of such 30-day period all unexercised options and stock
appreciation rights shall immediately terminate.

     12.    Corporate Mergers, Acquisitions, etc.    The Committee may
            ____________________________________
also grant options, stock appreciation rights, and stock bonuses and
issue restricted stock under the Plan having terms, conditions and
provisions that vary from those specified in this Plan, provided that
any such awards are granted in substitution for, or in connection with
the assumption of, existing options, stock appreciation rights, stock
bonuses, and restricted stock, awarded or issued by another corporation
and assumed or otherwise agreed to be provided for by the Company
pursuant to or by reason of a transaction involving a corporate merger,
consolidation, plan of exchange, acquisition of property or stock,
separation, reorganization or liquidation to which the Company or a
parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company is a party.

     13.    Amendment of Plan.    The Board of Directors may at any
            _________________
time, and from time to time, modify or amend the Plan in such respects
as it shall deem advisable because of changes in the law while the Plan
is in effect or for any other reason. Except as provided in paragraphs
6(f), 9, 10 and 11, however, no change in an award already granted shall
be made without the written consent of the holder of such award.

     14.    Approvals.    The obligations of the Company under the Plan
            _________
are subject to the approval of state and federal authorities or agencies
with jurisdiction in the matter. The Company will use its best efforts
to take steps required by state or federal law or applicable
regulations, including rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or trading system on which
the Company's shares may then be listed or admitted for trading, in
connection with the grants under the Plan. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated to issue or deliver
Class B Common Stock under the Plan if such issuance or delivery would
violate applicable state or federal securities laws.

     15.    Employment and Service Rights.    Nothing in the Plan or any
            _____________________________
award pursuant to the Plan shall (i) confer upon any employee any right
to be continued in the employment of the Company or any parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company or shall interfere in any way with
the right of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the
Company by whom such employee is employed to terminate such employee's
employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, or to
increase or decrease such employee's compensation or benefits, or (ii)
confer upon any person engaged by the Company any right to be retained
or employed by the Company or to the continuation, extension, renewal,
or modification of any compensation, contract, or arrangement with or by
the Company.

     16.    Rights as a Shareholder.    The recipient of any award under
            _______________________
the Plan shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any
Shares until the date of issue to the recipient of a stock certificate
for such Shares. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, no
adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the
record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.
