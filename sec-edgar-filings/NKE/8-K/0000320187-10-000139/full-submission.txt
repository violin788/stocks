Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q.</font></div>

In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s business, including equipment, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro are not included in these futures numbers.</font></div>

In June I talked about the momentum that we saw back in the back half of fiscal 2010, and Q1 shows how we are expanding on that momentum. Revenue, gross margin and profit are all up, global futures are up 13%, our biggest increase in over a decade; and our portfolio of affiliate brands Converse, Hurley, Cole Haan, NIKE Golf and Umbro, continues to gain strong momentum.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;As a result, we delivered exceptional earnings per share of $1.14 to our investors. Our first-quarter results are a great start to the year and demonstrate the tremendous growth potential of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio. Equally important is what's behind the numbers, and I point to three reasons for outstanding performance -- flexibility, balance and alignment.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Flexibility is about the power of our portfolio, our mix of brands and category offense. We're able to pull multiple levers across many dimensions of our business. For example, we can dial up the Running category to leverage successful new designs like the LunarGlide and Dynamic Stability. We can create momentum in Action Sports by combining three great brands across multiple sports and a single consumer experience. And in an environment where certain categories or geographies might be slower to recover, our diverse global portfolio allows us to create new growth in other key markets.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;This flexibility is strategic and powerful and unique to NIKE, Inc. Balance is all about leveraging innovation to create new opportunities. We fixate on superior performance product and then use that innovation to drive the style side of the business, something you can see clearly in the success of our Apparel business. We invest in direct-to-consumer retail and use that innovation to elevate our presence with our own retail partners.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;We take everything we know about the physical world of sports and we apply that knowledge to the potential of digital technology to create new experiences. We do these things to create short- and long-term opportunities that generate top- and bottom-line growth.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Finally, alignment, which is all about optimizing our resources to maximize return. When we're fully aligned across design, production, marketing and distribution, the result is experiences that only NIKE can create, like our Write the Future World Cup campaign, the U.S. Open of Surfing and the World Basketball Festival. All three of those events happened in Q1. We see the same power of alignment throughout the Company in design, our supply chain, in retail, in HR and operations and in marketing and sales. Alignment amplifies our resources to create unique and compelling successes for our consumers and shareholders.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;So the balance, flexibility and alignment that contributed to Q1 continue to position us for growth globally and locally. But it is not just about NIKE, it's also about driving innovation and potential into the market place. We work with a diverse set of retailers each with specific strengths and opportunities and we're uniquely able to amplify those strengths in a way that creates a consistently authentic and provocative presence for our brands, categories and products.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;When we combine that with our own retail executions in-store and online, we create an integrated yet differentiated market place that enables NIKE, Inc. to grow on multiple fronts. Even in a global market that still has some potential for turbulence, we are seeing evidence that our growth is accelerating and our leadership position is helping to lift the entire industry.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;That energy in the marketplace also illustrates an appetite for sports, innovative product and a desire for personal connection with our brands that has never been stronger, which is why I'm more optimistic now than I have ever been. It all starts and continues with deep and meaningful connections with athletes and consumers. That is where the insights are, that's where the innovation begins and that's where our growth is. And, ultimately that is where we serve athletes, consumers and shareholders.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Being flexible, balanced and aligned will also help us move through the continuing economic uncertainty ahead. Potential headwinds include all the usual suspects -- raw materials, energy, labor and transportation costs and FX rates, all of which have the potential to create pressure on margins through the back half of this fiscal year.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;To this point, I think we have proven our unique ability to manage through such circumstances. We have the scale and leverage to optimize our input costs, we have the ability to dial up discrete parts of the portfolio as opportunity arises, we have the capital to surgically and aggressively invest in new growth, we have the talent throughout the Company to execute with speed and precision. And, just as important, we're obsessed. We have the hunger to seek and develop the new ideas and inspiration that allow us to innovate and ultimately surprise and delight the athletes and consumers we are here to serve. That's why we are not guided by the vagaries of the macro economy. We're guided by our own potential and that potential has never been greater.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Now here's Charlie to take you through this more details on the NIKE Brand.</font></div>

Q1 was indeed a good quarter for the NIKE Brand. We posted some strong numbers and we're in good position to take advantage of the momentum we've worked hard to create. Let's go through some of the first quarter highlights.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Reported revenue was up 6% to $4.5 billion. SG&amp;A was up due to demand creation behind World Cup and the World Basketball Festival and our global futures are up 10% or 13% on a constant dollar basis, our highest in over a decade. This may not be the last time you hear that today.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;We feel a great about where we are what we've accomplished, but I'm even more excited about where the NIKE Brand can go. For the past year you've heard us talk about amplifying our innovation agenda and the power of sport through a category lens. In fact, nine months ago on our Q2 call, we laid out specific plans to pick up share and expand our leadership position across the industry worldwide -- Fresh Air in the Spring to drive Sportswear, industry-leading Football innovations around World Cup, Running strength driven by LunarGlide and Dynamic Stability and the evolution of Pro Combat Apparel. All of these category-specific efforts are paying off big time, just like we said they would.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;If we take a bit deeper dive into some of the examples that Mark opened with, you can see how we use that category lens to drive innovation across product, brand and at retail. In June we had our best World Cup effort ever. We broke new ground with a revolutionary traction technology and in high-performance Apparel with kits that were also our most sustainable ever. And whether you were 100 rows up in Soccer City Stadium or 10,000 miles away in your living room, there was no mistaking the iconic orange pop of the NIKE boots on the pitch.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Our Write the Future Football content was viewed more than 52 million times online and it was Andres Iniesta in a NIKE boot who kicked the winning goal for Spain in the final. I'm proud of both our brand and our commercial success at World Cup 2010. It was a championship performance and we're looking forward to winning again in Brazil in 2014.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;After the World Cup, it was onto the U.S. Open of Surfing. More than 600,000 people stormed Huntington Beach to watch Fred Sampson and Carissa Moore take the crowns. It was a massive celebration of surf, skate and BMX created by the leaders in Action Sports -- NIKE 6.0, Hurley and Converse. Then we put together the first World Basketball Festival. It was a four-day city-wide celebration to honor the Global Games and a tremendous showcase for NIKE Basketball, Jordan and Converse. I was especially inspired by Kevin Durant whose play and leadership earned him the MVP of the World Championships and established himself as an emerging force in the game going forward.</font></div>

Just a couple of weeks ago we launched our new NIKE + GPS app. It helps train, inspire and connect runners to the rest of the world anytime and anywhere. It's a very exciting example of how we can combine two high-performance businesses, Digital Sport and Running, to create a new experience for consumers and a new growth market for the NIKE Brand.</font></div>

We sold more LunarGlide shoes in Q1 than we did any other performance shoe in any other quarter in our history. It's also proving to be a powerful crossover shoe between technical performance and style, again, an opportunity we started talking about a few years ago and a perfect example of how performance product can drive both sides of the business.</font></div>

Our partner retail concepts have that same balance -- Foot Locker's House of Hoops, Finish Line's Running Lab, the Dick's Field House concept -- have quickly become meaningful and measurable formats that expand the overall market.

In recent quarters we've said that while we are cautious about the macro outlook we have great confidence in NIKE and we do see still see some challenges ahead. Input costs are headed higher as labor, oil and cotton become more expensive. We expect the rapid acceleration of our business will continue to increase sourcing and air freight costs in the near-term as we work to build capacity and meet surging demand.

Comp store sales at NIKE-owned retail stores increased 13% for the quarter while online sales increased 22%. Both were driven by higher traffic conversion and average transaction size.

Futures for Apparel increased over 20% as all seven key categories trended higher. This performance is a result of the hard work that we have done to improve our product as well as the power of the integrated category offense which particularly benefits our Apparel business.</font></div>

While macro conditions in Japan remain weak, we're very confident we're taking the steps that will generate growth over time. We're also focused on closely managing our product flow, cost structure and balance sheet. As a result, gross margin is up, inventory is down 30% and we continue to deliver healthy profitability and cash flow relative to the market.</font></div>

Revenues in Brazil, the largest market in the geography, grew nearly 70% in Q1 driven by Football and Sportswear.

While we do see some rough water ahead in the near-term, we believe these strategies will drive sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term. On a currency-neutral basis we expect FY11 revenue growth at the top end of our high-single-digit target range. Consistent with the difference in Futures, we expect reported revenue growth to be lower due to weaker foreign currencies versus last year.

Over the balance of the year we still expect increasing pressure from FX headwinds, rising input costs and higher freight costs. As a result, we now expect full-year FY11 gross margin about 50 basis points below FY10 with relatively flat margins in Q2 and more challenging comparisons in the second half as macro pressures increase and we begin to anniversary higher margins in the prior year.</font></div>

We're planning Q2 demand creation to grow at a low-single-digit rate with spending below prior year in the second half as we compare against the heavy investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 last year.

We expect Q2 operating overhead to grow at a low double-digit rate as a result of the timing of stock option expense this year and comparisons to relatively low expenses in last year's second quarter. We anticipate that other income for each of the last three quarters of the fiscal year will be broadly consistent with Q4 of last year as the stronger dollar creates gains on our foreign currency hedges.</font></div>

As we've talked about before as we negotiate prices with our factories several seasons out, and so as a result when commodity costs move we usually see that impact flow into our products over a number of different -- over a number of seasons. And we expected those cost increases to hit us more heavily in the first quarter than they actually did. We still expect to see those increases in cost to some extent flow into our cost structure over the rest of the year. But we did have actually a less significant impact in the first quarter than we originally expected.</font></div>

As we talked about, the performance product has accelerated at a faster pace than the Sportswear area. So the sports specialty channels and the athletic sporting goods channels are all doing extremely well. When you look at some of the value chain and department store areas, those&#160;are still up, and if they're more dependent on Sportswear may not be accelerating quite as fast.</font></div>

I guess, one question, if you could just maybe elaborate on inventories in terms of how we should be looking at that. You guys have done a nice job there. Any thoughts as we progress forward? Obviously business accelerating, futures accelerating. Does that start to I guess increase as we kind of move forward here?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;I think, again, I'm going to go back a little bit of what Mark just said. I think with the balance increased across the portfolio and our ability to continue to manage the supply chain top to bottom, whether it's the inventories at retail or the inventories at wholesale, we've continued to keep a pretty tight rein on things as this period of instability or whatever the macros are looking like, and we will continue to do that. That being said, obviously, with the futures numbers what they are, we feel very good about the levels that they are at and our ability to manage the inventories over the next short and long-term.</font></div>

I guess, Don, the second question for you. I just want go to the back to the gross margin thought process. Initially when you gave your fiscal year guidance, you talked about possibly a 100-basis-point decline in gross margin and it now seems like down maybe 50 at most here. Given how inventories are positioned, and I know there's headwinds in the business here on the product cost side, can you maybe just put in buckets where your biggest concerns and maybe where the opportunities could potentially be, whether the outperformance is just on the direct consumer business performing better? Or do you face more difficult comparisons there and that maybe gives you some concern or some reservation? I'm just trying to see the puts and takes on
 that margin.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> Well, we always have goals that we set for ourselves in terms of improving margins. Over the long haul as we've said, we do believe that we can continue to expand our margins. We have quite a few initiatives in place and our product teams and category groups aimed at reducing product costs, at improving the efficiency of our supply chain. We have talked about the way we approach pricing on a very surgical basis, so we're always looking for opportunities in that space.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;So on the wholesale side of the business, we continue to work in that direction. Direct-to-consumer, as I said, was a very pleasant upside in the first quarter. The business there is quite strong and that has a very high margin compared to the wholesale business. And we also have been improving margins in our Direct-to-Consumer operations through better operations and better merchandising.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;So we always set ourselves pretty aggressive goals on trying to expand margins over time. As Charlie referenced earlier, the quality of our inventory and the fact that we're so tight in the market place means we're going to sell at top margins and low discounts.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&#160;Having said that, that is really what is embedded in a lot of our results in the first quarter and we're going to continue to drive those. Over the balance of the year I think the main story that I think is going to lead us to a little bit less favorable on the gross margin front is just that macro inflation that we think will start to flow through in the next three quarters.</font></div>

Is it fair to say that things like freight, currency and labor in that order are the pressure points because you're flying in goods?

There's -- oil over time we think is a factor, although oil has been relatively benign. And then cotton is a relatively smaller factor than, say, labor or freight, but it is out there. We've built those assumptions into our expectations at this point.</font></div>

I referenced a couple of them in my prepared remarks. Those programs are going on literally around the world with regards to dedicated space, whether it's on a category basis or across an entire brand similar to what you're seeing with Dicks. And it's certainly part of the strategy, as we move to more of a dedicated category focused in the marketplace as well as aligned with the way we're organized in the Company here, and it's certainly what's driving it is our connection with the consumer.</font></div>

If I could ask one more question about -- you mentioned the NIKE Free product, the new technology, but I think you had said in your prepared comments that it was coming out in the Spring, and I had been under the impression there was new NIKE Free product coming out in the Fall. Has this changed, or is this incremental to what's happening in the Fall?</font></div>

The freight rates are up fairly significantly year-on-year for both air and ocean, and we are doing more air freighting than what we have seen in the past. And I think, given the strength of the futures book that we're seeing right now, I think it's going to be -- most of this year, we're going to see somewhat elevated levels of airfreight.</font></div>

Just a follow-up on the SG&amp;A side. The benefit of stock-based compensation that you called out to the overhead this quarter, is there lumpiness in that, or is it something we should see continue through the balance of the year?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

So where it was before was very much loaded in the first quarter. It is now much smoother across the quarter. So what you will see from a year-on-year standpoint is a benefit in the first quarter, and then higher expense year on year in the second, third, fourth. And then as we go into fiscal '12, it will smooth out.</font></div>

Right now, I think you&#8217;ve seen some of the new executions in store with Apparel, Women's Apparel, specifically around the bottoms bar and the bra bars that we've put into some of the new retail formats. That is it performing extremely well and we're very excited and optimistic about the Apparel side of the equation in Women's. And as I referenced a little bit earlier and I think we talked about it, some of the new Free products are coming into the market in holiday and will be highlighted in a major campaign around the Free technology, which to Mark's earlier point continues to evolve for Spring, and that will bring a lot more attention to the Women's business
 again.</font></div>

Just some quick back of the napkin math suggests almost half the EBIT growth in the quarter was from the Other Businesses line, and I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail on what some the big drivers in that business were, and maybe as you think about it through the year.

We see both top-line performance, particularly with Converse, Hurley, Umbro, Cole Haan. We're seeing tremendous top-line growth there as well, great brand strength building, again I think led by Converse. So we're very happy with the strength of the portfolio.</font></div>

Again, I think it's a combination of brand strength, strong product, in some cases some repositioning of the brand like Cole Haan for example, where we're contemporizing both the product and the brand presentation. So we feel very good about the individual brand efforts, and then, again, how we're working collectively to really integrate the portfolio and leverage that.</font></div>

I think when you look at the math, the North American business, for example, in the NIKE Brand is up very strongly, as are the Emerging Market profitability numbers. And what you have to bear in mind is, a lot of FX drag in the international NIKE businesses, most of the affiliate businesses are US-based. The other issue is World Cup. There's a tremendous investment in the first quarter around World Cup that you didn't see as much of that on the affiliate side. So, I think if you look at this over the course of the year, you're going to see a little bit more balanced 
growth. But, having said that, as Mark indicated, the affiliates are doing phenomenally well.</font></div>

So I'm just kind of curious if you could help us get maybe an updated idea of how much of the China business is done through the Futures window. Should we be looking at the -- I'm sorry -- the 23% futures there, excluding currency? And should we be thinking, maybe there's -- I guess I'm just trying to think about how we should think about revenues into the next quarter since it came in a little bit below that 16 you guys had last quarter. Thanks.</font></div>

So as far as the divergence that you speak of, I would have to go back and look at it quarter-by-quarter. But we shouldn't see any dramatic changes in the way that that formula is working.</font></div>

Can you provide any perspective on the profitability progress you're seeing in Apparel, and how long you think the runway is on that?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;I would say, Jim, that the profitability on the Apparel side is, broadly speaking, not too different from Footwear. The performance product in Apparel is what's really driving the growth. We've also really seen the Sportswear business move up the price scale. So we're making great progress there. Of course, the last few comments I made about Apparel in my prepared remarks, we're seeing great performance on the full-price Apparel and a lot lower closeout. So, a combination of all of those things, we're seeing great progress on the profitability side on Apparel.</font></div>

I think that does give us an opportunity, both on the performance side of the business and in a premium brand position, to go after some potential margin expansion and Apparel.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Two other quick factors that you should be aware of is, Apparel is another example of the category offense really starting to click into gear here. Really seeing that results in better product, just managing the business better, reducing our style count and really focusing on style productivity. So really some basic elements that really are running a successful Apparel business, we're really starting to see the category offense really help turbocharge all that effort.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Jim Duffy&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Great, and then a second question regarding the balance of the futures across the futures window. Do you have capacity challenges? Do you think that retailers to any extent are pulling forward orders to ensure availability of key products? Is that something that's influencing the futures orders?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Well, I think there may be a little bit of that. but it is sustaining itself. So we're seeing it pretty consistently all the way through the windows. So the fact of the matter is, if it is happening then it's an ongoing practice that has been going on. That being said, I don't think it's a material amount in regard to the key products that we're talking about. Because if we are up against any capacity constraints we are allocating the products. The retailers are familiar with the program and it ensures both quality and on-time delivery by doing that. So, I don't think it's going to be a material effect on the window overall.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Omar Saad&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;I actually have two questions. I wanted to follow-up on Jim's last question about demand exceeding supply. Typically, that price becomes a tool in those situations where the demand is stronger than the supply. How do you think about using price as a tool, given the environment and you have having to airfreight stuff over and chase capacity.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;I think something that we talk about a lot is the price-value relationship in the marketplace and continuing to operate both on a premium brand position, but just as well being very acutely aware of what that price-value relationship with the consumer is. So as we've continued to talk all along, we're always looking at surgical and strategic areas where we may have some elasticity in pricing, and we will continue to do so throughout this time period. But I don't think we want to get too aggressive in this area right now with all of the uncertainty that there is out there in the marketplace. So it's something that we look at every quarter as we take the lines to market and assess the overall price-value relationship and compare it with the dem
and and try and make those decisions accordingly.</font></div>

The SG&amp;A control in the quarter actually looked quite excellent, especially given that it was a World Cup quarter. And then I even heard you talk about, it sounds like SG&amp;A, kind of demand creation and the overhead side growing in the mid-single digits when your sales guidance was above, there's a little bit of leverage happening this year. Is this a function of the fact that there may be aren't as many major sporting events this year to spur demand creation, or is this an ancillary benefit of kind of the reorganization around categories that maybe allows you to lever SG&amp;A?</font></div>

Obviously without the big events during the year, it does give us the ability to take a breath, step back and evaluate where we are from a brand standpoint. But overall, I think it's going to be a little bit of both.</font></div>

And, the thing that I think is most important to focus on here is what we&#8217;re investing in is working. The category offense requires that we get the product right, that we connect the brand and that we are distributing in a premium way to that category lens. That really is clicking through. We have made that investment, we're going to continue to make those investments, they are paying off. They're generating the top-line growth and the profitability.</font></div>

So we're seeing a much tighter relationship, I think, between the categories and geographies, and a much more surgical focus on really getting behind the opportunities that are going to give us the best return. So I think that's a big part of that picture.</font></div>

The first one, just the China backlog up 23% constant currency, any sense you can give us on how much of that is a same-store sales reacceleration of the existing base, or are you re-accelerating your licensed stores over there?</font></div>

A lot of other people out there saw, I think even some your customers, saw same-store sales decelerate in the -- in that time frame, that sort of June, July, August time frame. So can you give us a sense whether your flagships did terrific, or your outlets comped great, or US comps versus Europe, etc., would be really helpful, I think, to all of us. Thanks.</font></div>

We continue to move into the second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-tier markets at a relatively conservative rate as we talked about in the last couple of calls. That being said, I think you're seeing the business acceleration on a store-for-store basis as we see ourselves taking more share, as well as the market starting to pick up a little bit more on the growth side. So, I think that's what you're looking at. And I mentioned I think a little in the prepared remarks, the categories that are really driving that are Basketball, Running and NIKE Sportswear in China. Those three categories continue to see a very strong growth curve.</font></div>

And, just quickly looking at Europe, Europe were both -- the in-line stores were about flat and the outlets comped up a bit.
