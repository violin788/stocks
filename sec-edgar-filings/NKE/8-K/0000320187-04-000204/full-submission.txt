Exhibit 99.1

Starbucks CEO Orin C. Smith Appointed to Nike's Board of Directors;
Philip Knight Recognizes the Contributions of Three Retiring Directors

Beaverton, OR (September 21, 2004) --Following its annual meeting of
shareholders on September 20, Nike, Inc. (NYSE: NKE) appointed Starbucks
president and CEO Orin C. Smith to its board of directors. Nike's board
of directors now numbers 10.

Mr. Smith, 62, has served as president and CEO of Starbucks since 2000.
He joined Starbucks as vice president and chief financial officer in
1990 and became president and chief operating officer in 1994. During
his tenure at Starbucks, the company has grown from $285 million in
revenue to $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2003.

"Orin is a perfect match for Nike," said Philip H. Knight, chairman and
CEO of Nike, Inc. "Orin manages one of the most successful and admired
companies and brands in the world. That, combined with his strong
financial management expertise, makes him an outstanding addition to our
board."

Prior to joining Starbucks, Mr. Smith spent a total of 14 years with
Deloitte & Touche. He was later the executive vice president and chief
financial officer of two transportation companies. In between these
assignments, he was chief policy and finance officer in the
administration of two Washington State Governors. He received his
Bachelor's of Arts degree in business administration from the University
of Washington and MBA from Harvard Business School.

Mr. Smith will serve on Nike's Audit Committee along with Alan B. Graf,
Jr., chairman of the committee and executive vice president and chief
financial officer of FedEx Corporation, and Delbert J. Hayes, a Nike
director since 1975.

At its annual meeting of shareholders Mr. Knight also recognized the
contributions of three retiring directors - John E. Jaqua, 83; Richard
K. Donahue, 77; and Charles W. Robinson, 83.

"John, Dick and Chuck were instrumental in building this company into
what it is today," Mr. Knight said. "I have worked closely these
distinguished executives since the early days of Nike and their
leadership has helped Nike become a $12-billion global company. I am
deeply grateful for their years of dedicated service. I just hate to see
them retire at such a young age."

Mr. Jaqua joined the Nike board in 1968 and served as corporate
secretary from 1969 to 2002. He has been a principal in the law firm of
Jaqua & Wheatley, P.C. since 1962 and has served as president of the
Oregon State Bar Association and as a State Delegate to the House of
Delegates of the American Bar Association. Mr. Jaqua served on the
Compensation Committee.

Mr. Donahue has been a board member since 1977 and was vice chairman of
the board. He served as president and chief operating officer of the
company from 1990 until 1994. He has been a partner in the law firm of
Donahue & Donahue since 1951. From 1961 to 1963 he was an assistant to
President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Donahue served on the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee and the Corporate Responsibility
Committee.

Mr. Robinson, a director since 1978, is Chairman and President of
Robinson & Associates, Inc., a venture capital firm. He served as Under-
Secretary of State for Economic Affairs from 1974 to 1976. Mr. Robinson
is also a director of Allen Telecom, Inc., and a trustee of The
Brookings Institution. He served on the Audit Committee and was Chairman
of the Finance Committee.
