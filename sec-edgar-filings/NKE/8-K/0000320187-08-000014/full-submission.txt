BEAVERTON, Ore. (19 March, 2008) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2008. For the
quarter, revenue grew 16 percent to $4.5 billion, compared to $3.9 billion
for the same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates
increased revenue growth by 6 percentage points for the quarter. Third
quarter net income grew 32 percent to $463.8 million, compared to $350.8
million in the prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 35
percent to $0.92, versus $0.68 last year.

"A year ago we established the goal of reaching $23 billion in revenues by
our fiscal year 2011 and outlined our strategy for achieving that goal
while continuing to deliver profitable, sustainable growth and outstanding
returns to our shareholders," said Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. President and
Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong third quarter results, driven by
sales gains across our diversified portfolio of categories, geographies,
and brands, are a clear indication that our strategy is working and that
we're on track to achieve our financial goals for this fiscal year and
beyond."*

Parker continued, "Over the past twelve months we've taken a number of
important strategic steps to strengthen the performance and potential of
our portfolio of products and brands, steps we believe create stronger
platforms for growth and allow us to connect even deeper with consumers.
More than ever, the consumer is at the epicenter of everything we do and
delivering the most innovative products and the most exciting consumer
experiences is the key to our future growth."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2008 through July 2008,
totaling $6.9 billion, 11 percent higher than such orders reported for the
same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased
reported orders growth by 2 percentage points.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 1 percent; Europe (which
includes the Middle East and Africa) increased 12 percent; Asia Pacific
grew 32 percent; and the Americas increased 20 percent. Changes in
currency exchange rates increased reported futures orders growth in Europe
by 3 percentage points and by 7 percentage points in Asia Pacific. In the
Americas region changes in currency exchange rates did not have a
significant impact on futures growth.*

Commenting on these developments, Parker said, "Our focus on prime growth
opportunities extends throughout our portfolio of brands. We are confident
that our divestiture decisions are the right ones for Bauer Hockey,
Starter, and Nike.  Our most recent acquisition, Umbro, is a brand that
has tremendous heritage and respect in global football. This acquisition
represents an opportunity to create value for shareholders and consumers
by applying our product, brand-building and operational capabilities to a
business with enormous growth potential around the world."*
