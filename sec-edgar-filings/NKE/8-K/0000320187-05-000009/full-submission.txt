     This Agreement is made effective as of March 1, 2005 by and
between NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation, with principal offices at
One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453 ("Owner"), and William

                             RECITALS

     WHEREAS, Owner is the registered Owner of that certain civil
Aircraft bearing the United States Registration Number N6453, and of
the type Dassault Falcon 2000EX ("the Aircraft" or "Aircraft"); and

hereby agree as follows:

1.     Lease of Aircraft.  Owner agrees to lease the Aircraft to Lessee
       _________________
pursuant to the provisions of FAR 91-501(c)(1) and to provide a fully
qualified flight crew for all operations for the period commencing on
the date of this Agreement and terminating on the date Lessee ceases to
serve in the capacity of at least President or Chief Executive Officer
of NIKE, Inc.

2.     Expenses.  Lessee shall pay Owner for each flight conducted
       ________
under this Agreement the aggregate incremental cost of each specific
flight.  Such cost shall in no event exceed the sum of the following
expenses authorized by FAR 91-501(d):

(a)  Fuel, oil, lubricants, and other additives;
(b)  Travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging and ground
     transportation;
(c)  Hangar and tie down costs away from the Aircraft's base of
     operation;
(d)  Insurance obtained for a specific flight;
(e)  Landing fees, airport taxes and similar assessments including, but
     not limited to IRC Section 4261 and related excise taxes;
(f)  Customs, foreign permit, and similar fees directly related to the
     flight;
(g)  In-flight food and beverages;
(h)  Passenger ground transportation;
(i)  Flight planning and weather contract services; and
(j)  An additional charge equal to 100% of the expenses listed in
     subparagraph (a) of this Section.

3.     Payment of Expenses.  Owner will pay all expenses related to the
       ___________________
operation of the Aircraft when incurred, and will provide an invoice
and bill Lessee for the expenses enumerated in Section 2 above on the
last day of the month in which any flight or flights for the account of
Lessee occur.  Lessee shall pay Owner for said expenses within 30 days
of receipt of the invoice and bill therefor.

4.     Scheduling.  Lessee will provide Owner with requests for flight
       __________
time and proposed flight schedules as far in advance of any given
flight as possible, and in any case, at least 24 hours in advance of
Lessee's planned departure.  Requests for flight time shall be in a
form, whether written or oral, mutually convenient to, and agreed upon
by the parties.  In addition to the proposed schedules and flight
times, Lessee shall provide at least the following information for each
proposed flight at some time prior to scheduled departure as required
by the Owner or Owner's flight crew:

(a)   proposed departure point;
(b)   destination;
(c)   date and time of flight;
(d)   the number of anticipated passengers;
(e)   the nature and extent of luggage and/or cargo to be carried;
(f)   the date and time of return flight, if any; and
(g)   any other information concerning the proposed flight that may be
      pertinent or required by Owner or Owner's flight crew.

5.     Conflicts in Scheduling.  Owner shall have final authority over
       _______________________
the scheduling of the Aircraft, provided, however, that Owner will use
its best efforts to accommodate Lessee's needs and to avoid conflicts
in scheduling.

6.     Maintenance.  Owner shall be solely responsible for securing
       ___________
maintenance, preventive maintenance and required or otherwise necessary
inspections on the aircraft, and shall take such requirements into
account in scheduling the Aircraft.  No period of maintenance,
preventive maintenance or inspection shall be delayed or postponed for
the purpose of scheduling the aircraft, unless said maintenance or
inspection can be safely conducted at a later time in compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations, and within the sound discretion of
the pilot in command.  The pilot in command shall have final and
complete authority to cancel any flight for any reason or condition
which in his judgment would compromise the safety of the flight.

7.     Flight Crew.  Owner shall employ, pay for, and provide to Lessee
       ___________
a qualified flight crew for each flight undertaken under this
Agreement.

8.     Judgment of Flight Crew.  In accordance with applicable FAR, the
       _______________________
qualified flight crew provided by Owner will exercise all of its duties
and responsibilities in regard to the safety of each flight conducted
hereunder.  Lessee specifically agrees that the flight crew, in its
sole discretion, may terminate any flight, refuse to commence any
flight, or take other action, which in the considered judgment of the
pilot in command is necessitated by considerations of safety.  No such
action of the pilot in command shall create or support any liability
for loss, injury, damage or delay to Lessee or any other person.  The
parties further agree that Owner shall not be liable for delay or
failure to furnish the aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement
when such failure is caused by government regulation or authority,
mechanical difficulty, war, civil commotion, strikes or labor disputes,
weather conditions, or acts of God.

9.     Additional Insurance.  Owner will provide such additional
       ____________________
insurance coverage as Lessee shall request or require, provided,
however, that the cost of such additional insurance shall be borne by
Lessee as set forth in Section 2(d) hereof.

10.     Lessee Warranties.  Lessee warrants that:
        _________________
    (a)  He will use the Aircraft for and on account of his own
         business only, and will not use the Aircraft for the purpose
         of providing transportation of passengers or cargo in air
         commerce for compensation or hire;

    (b)  He shall refrain from incurring any mechanics or other lien in
         connection with inspection, preventive maintenance,
         maintenance or storage of the Aircraft, whether permissible or
         impermissible under this Agreement, nor shall there be any
         attempt by any party hereto to convey, mortgage, assign, lease
         or any way alienate the Aircraft or create any kind of lien or
         security interest involving the Aircraft or do anything or
         take any action that might mature into such a lien; and

    (c)  During the term of this Agreement, he will abide by and
         conform to all such laws, governmental and airport orders,
         rules and regulations, as shall from time to time be in effect
         relating in any way to the operation and use of the Aircraft
         by a time-sharing Lessee.

11.     Base of Operation.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
        _________________
permanent base of operation of the Aircraft shall be the Hillsboro
airport, Hillsboro, Oregon.

12.     Assignment; Binding Effect.  Neither this Agreement nor any
        __________________________
party's interest herein shall be assignable to any other party
whatsoever.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
