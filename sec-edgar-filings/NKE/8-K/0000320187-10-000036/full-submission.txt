Hello everyone and Happy St. Patrick's Day. Thank you very much for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2010 third-quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
And if we do so, you will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, nikebiz.com.</font></div>

do our best to come back to you. Thank you very much for your cooperation on this.</font></div>

On our last call I said, given what we know about the marketplace and about ourselves, we are well-positioned to leverage the power of Global Sports and drive hard against those growth opportunities that have the
most impact. Q3 shows this to be the case. NIKE is more than a survivor in these tough economic times. We are able to manage up and through the recession to expand separation for our brands and our businesses.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We have returned to top and bottom line growth in our third quarter, both on a real and constant dollar basis. With few exceptions we are seeing improving trends across all NIKE Brand product types, categories and geographies, as seen in our strong acceleration of global futures orders.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our Other Businesses continue to deliver brand heat, while increasing revenue and profits. And we are delivering record cash flows, driven by clean inventory positions and the tightest supply chain we have ever had.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We are very pleased by the results for the quarter. Revenue increased 7% to $4.7 billion. Inventories are in great shape, down about 13% compared to last year. Gross margins were up 3 points due to hot products, elevated consumer experiences in the marketplace, and operational excellence inside.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Worldwide NIKE Brand futures are up 9%, and 6% on a currency neutral basis. Converse continues to expand in virtually every dimension of the business, product, brand and financial. Hurley is outperforming all competitors in their market. Umbro has delivered over 20% revenue growth year to date, and is poised for a positive World Cup season.
And NIKE Golf and Cole Haan continue to deliver innovation and manage healthy inventories, and are well-positioned for recovery in their industries.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It is important to remember how we are able to deliver this kind of quarter in this kind of environment. Now many of the reasons are familiar to you. Now we have the most compelling and innovative product. We have deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. And we run this Company with an eye toward efficiency, opportunity and growth.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Two things I want to cover in a bit more depth. The first is apparel. This is the single biggest opportunity for NIKE, Inc. We are already one of the world's largest apparel companies, but that is nothing compared to what is possible in this space.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Two years ago we refocused the apparel business with specific objectives for both the performance and sportswear sides of the business. Our performance apparel continues to be strong and lead in innovation, gaining marketshare and creating growth.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">For NIKE, performance is the anchor of our brands. You see it in the National Team kits we launched in London, and in the competitive and replica apparel for the Vancouver Winter games. In every category performance takes the lead.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Sportswear we see the benefits of being a good editor on the product level. We are focusing on fewer, more productive styles. And that helps us achieve some crucial benefits -- a clear premium position for the brand, a powerful connection to performance, and ultimately a more efficient and more profitable apparel business.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">When we amplify this connection to sports we create more distinction for the brand, and we offer easier and more attractive choices for consumers. And NIKE has the unique ability to pull that lever.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We have been working on our apparel business for some time, and we really began to see the impact in Q3. NIKE Brand Apparel revenues grew 3% for the quarter, while gross margins expanded 160 basis points and inventories fell 8%.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We are also starting to realize the broader benefits of becoming a better retailer. Over the past few years we have spoken about expanding our Direct-to-Consumer business. We saw a huge upside to bringing innovation and excitement into the marketplace in our own stores, with our wholesale partners and online.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">To do that we committed to building our retail capabilities, smoother product flow, surgical assortment planning that focuses on key items, more compelling merchandising, stronger brand stories, and more efficient back of house systems. All balanced to produce greater consumer experiences and strong profitability.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It is a powerful mix that helped NIKE Brand retail deliver 11% revenue growth and 140 basis points of gross margin expansion year-to-date.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We will continue to invest in bringing world-class solutions to consumers who are hungry for new retail experiences. Nowhere is this more important than online. The digital lifestyle is driving dramatic change in our industry and significant potential to our Company. We are attacking that in every dimension, online shopping, customization,
immersing our brands in consumer cultures, and telling inspiring and entertaining stories.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So the question is what can we learn about NIKE by looking at apparel and retail? What can we learn from our surging business in China, where NIKE's product innovation and premium brand position continue to connect with the burgeoning middle class? Why are we aggressively expanding digitally enabled sport and creating the next level generation
of NIKE+ technology? It all shows our ability to create innovation in the marketplace and leverage our resources and capability to deliver growth.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We have made a lot of investments over the last few years aimed at enhancing our ability to innovate and grow. We moved to a category offense and refocused on apparel. We reorganized to become a leaner and stronger company. We are expanding our retail influence, and leading in the move toward a greener, more sustainable future. And we continue
to amplify the key moments in sports around the world. In short, we have continued to lead the industry by challenging ourselves to become better at every turn.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It all points to one word, momentum. While others froze or retrenched over the past two years, we never stopped moving. We never stop designing better products. We never stopped making deep connections to consumer communities. We never stopped increasing the strength of our balance sheet or building a stronger company for our shareholders.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And because we never stopped it is easier for us to gain speed and momentum. That to me is the story of Q3. While some companies are still trying to decide what to do and when to do it, NIKE is accelerating. In just the next three months alone we will see March Madness and the Final Four, The Masters, the NBA Playoffs, the French Open and
Wimbledon, the London and Boston Marathons, the Champions League, and of course, the World Cup.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">These are the moments that we rally around at NIKE. And they go on for as far as the eye can see. On to London in 2012 and Brazil in 2014 and 2016 and beyond. For NIKE it is a future defined by two things, a wealth of opportunity and our ability to invest surgically and aggressively to maximize growth.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Thanks, and now here's Charlie.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Charlie Denson:</font> Thanks, Mark. Hello, everybody. I will apologize in advance for a little bit of a nasal tone. I am suffering from my annual spring cold. But with that said, you have heard us talk many times about how we work to differentiate ourselves in the
marketplace. We do it by addressing consumer benefits through innovation, connecting with consumers through our brand, and creating compelling retail experience for our consumers.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We all saw the same events unfold over the last years. We read the same headlines, asked the same questions, and had the same concerns. When I look at our Q3 results I see the confidence we have in our brand and our business, delivering results against the opportunities we talked about on these calls all the time.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We innovate, not just for the sake of innovation, but to continuously supply benefits for the athlete. We operated with discipline in the marketplace, managing our buys and our inventories. That keeps the brand premium. And we keep a close watch on costs, while continuing to build brand strength.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It is a strategy that illustrates how we sustained growth even in a tough environment. Q3 was a strong quarter for NIKE and a big quarter for sports. Four of our seven key categories delivered increased revenue. Gross margins expanded, futures are up, inventories remain lean. And worldwide NIKE Direct-to-Consumer delivered a 19% revenue increase
and a 390 basis point increase in gross margins.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">There are a couple of patterns that I see in our results. First, consumers continue to rely on trusted, authentic brands. Second, as Mark said, we are able to innovate and manage up and out of the recession, because we never stopped doing what we do best. As we said this time last year, managing costs is crucial. But these are also the times
when we can really separate with a strong brand and weakened competition.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>

On the category side we took advantage of the global stage at the Vancouver Olympics, where NIKE athletes excelled in both action sports, as well as the traditional winter sports. Bodie Miller, Julia Mancuso, Shani Davis, Kim Yu-Na, and dozens of other NIKE athletes brought home a box
full of medals. If you needed a reminder about the passion of sport, you got a great dose of it in the gold medal hockey game.</font></div>

NIKE had a big NBA All-Star break. Our marquee product from Kobe and LeBron continues to sell through very well. On the apparel side, our brand-new collegiate jerseys weigh 60% less than the league-sanctioned jerseys in the NBA. And we think ours even look better too.</font></div>

Those are in NIKE footwear. 46 in men's and 49 in women's, they are head to toe. But the big question is, can anybody beat the UConn
women.</font></div>

Dwyane Wade won the NBA's All-Star MVP wearing the new Jordan 2010 game shoe.

I already mentioned that worldwide revenue from NIKE Direct-to-Consumer was up 19%. Revenue in North America was up 20%, and gross margins were up 550 basis points. I think that is a pretty strong indicator of a couple of things. First, when you give consumers compelling products they will buy them.

SG&amp;A for the quarter increased 16% on a reported basis, and 11% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding currency changes, demand creation was 11% higher than last year due to heavier spending to support third-quarter marketing initiatives this year, including the Winter Olympics, compared

Revenues in Brazil grew over 60%, as we continue to expand distribution and excitement builds for the World Cup. Mexico and the Southern Cone territory, that is Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay, each delivered growth of about 30%,
while the largest market in the geography, Korea, posted 15% growth for the quarter. Focus on the key categories of Football, Running and Sportswear fueled the growth. And futures are up 36% on a currency neutral basis. Third-quarter EBIT for the Emerging Markets increased 72%, driven by revenue growth and SG&amp;A leverage.</font></div>

Just two quick questions focused on the U.S. market. Can you just speak a little bit more about this sort of uptick you are saying in the footwear futures orders? And what -- is it unit volume driven? Is
it ASP driven? Is it a specific channel or is it very broad? It is nice to see the sequential acceleration, but I think some of the numbers you gave out are pretty surprising. Is there a big cycle going on here?</font></div>

I will talk about North America U.S. footwear business first. It is fairly broad. Our average selling prices are up a little bit. The unit numbers are up a little bit. And so we are seeing those complement each other. It is having over
more than just a single category. So -- as well as across more than just a single channel.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we are very happy and pleased at the balance of the acceleration as much as just the -- specifically around footwear. Then the third piece of the puzzle that probably excites me personally as much as anything is the apparel numbers in North America. So I think it does speak to the strength of the brand overall. And as we said in some of
the prepared remarks, when we are introducing new and compelling product there is still an appetite. So that I feel good about.</font></div>

We feel very good about the insights that we are gaining from consumers in our women's training segment. We have some new product coming into the marketplace as early as this fall, and into holiday and next spring. And we are continuing to stay committed and focused on
the performance authentic end of that spectrum, and continuing to innovate and to find benefits for that female consumer. I think overall it is exciting to see the female consumer respond.</font></div>

I think -- well, if you will recall, a couple of years back we started talking about reorganizing our apparel model where we had engines or product creation units around the world. What it did was it created a lot of different styles
that at the end of the day were somewhat duplicative of each other. We have consolidated that into a global engine where they are focusing on those key products that make the most difference.</font></div>

First of all, the expansion year-on-year you need to bear in mind some of the prior year comparisons. And I think what you're seeing this quarter is really a much cleaner supply chain, a
cleaner marketplace.</font></div>

So that is certainly an important part of the equation. There is also the impact of the timing of demand creation spending. Last year we were spending more heavily against the business this quarter, so we've got less of that.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So in terms of year-on-year improvement it is really a cleaner marketplace and some of the timing on demand creation spending.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As far as the overall profitability of that market, one of the things to bear in mind is that a lot of the demand creation spending that we use to help drive the business in China is actually recorded somewhere else. So the marketing mix in China is actually a blend of global assets and local assets. It is the way we market the brand there.
So Kobe and LeBron are tremendously popular in China. Those expenses are reported in North America.</font></div>

And one of the reasons why we give you a unit number too is that currencies have been pretty volatile. So that unit number we gave you, minus 14, on the NIKE Brand, that gives
you an indication of the absolute level of inventory reduction.</font></div>

Certainly we have seen a reacceleration of futures, and that means that we will certainly need the inventory to support that business.</font></div>

It is a culmination of a lot of investment in systems and people and process.

implications of running a tight supply chain.</font></div>

And if I could ask a follow-up question to China. Is there any way you can break down for us the growth that we are seeing in China? Is any growth coming from marketshare gains yet in that market? And what has been the
trend for ASPs?</font></div>

As far as the marketshare gains, it depends on how you segment the market. So in the premium space we are seeing marketshare gains. We are also seeing overall growth in the marketplace. So you have to get into some level of granularity,
and I'm not sure exactly where you were going as far as that goes. And we are also seeing growth in both footwear and apparel. So I think those are the two primary ways we look at it, from a price point premium standpoint, as well as the product types.</font></div>

So the throughput on existing points of distribution grows as the middle class has more disposable income. And we
are expanding distribution into new cities and new shopping districts.</font></div>

excited about some of the growth we have seen in the Football categories. We have made great progress in Running in Germany, for example. So absolutely, we believe that is a place where we can continue to pick up share.</font></div>

Happy St. Patrick's Day everybody. I have a question for both Mark and Charlie -- I guess everybody really. In that it has been a really tough year overall. If I look back at what was happening at this time last year from February,
I guess, through about May it was -- there were a lot of very difficult calls being made over there. When you dial the clock back and you look at how things were then versus how they are right now, could you give us some kind of feel as to how it is like walking the halls now from an overall energy level relative to a year ago?</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Let me jump in on that. This is Mark. A big difference I think here -- nothing creates energy internally versus growth, and a positive trend in terms of how NIKE is being received, how consumers are responding, the things that we have done around
some of the major sporting events into last year and the success we have had, that really breathes the most positive energy, I think possible.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In that respect it is a much different climate, because we have delivered, I think. The product is stronger. As I said, the energy around some of these big sporting events is very palpable. The leadership -- we tend to -- as I say often, we focus on our potential, not on the distance between NIKE and our competition.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I am really proud of where we are in that respect. We never sit back and feel comfortable with where we are, despite how successful a quarter we might have, because we are always looking at the potential ahead. I think the energy around that for NIKE is as strong as it has ever been.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Then I also think people see the strength of the product in the pipeline, what is coming. I mentioned just a short list of some of the big sporting events over the next few months. So people are really excited about that and what that represents to NIKE. We rally around those things. And that is where you see great innovation, great product,
great marketing. And I am really personally very proud of what we have done and what you will see over the next 90 days or so.</font></div>

Then one more question. It is a little long, so please bear with me. But both for you Mark and also Don, I was hoping you could both address just your overall capital structure in the context of where the strategic vision is over there
in the upcoming two to three years. I mean, you've got the $4 billion in cash right now, which I think is about the size of all of the non-NIKE brands out there in the U.S. market, which is a little scary. Well, it is good.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">There is not a whole heck of a lot out there with your business for overall cap spending -- spending requirements. There is not a lot of acquisitions out there, at least that would be big needle movers. And I think we know your stand on stock repo and also dividends. So while I am not encouraging an all-out spending blitz, I was just hoping
for more thoughts about just what you think about as far as whether you currently have the capital structure to turn this business from being a $20 billion company into $25 billion or $30 billion. Is what has been done recently as far as always all of your reset, is that enough or might you still need to think outside the box as to how you deploy that capital?</font></div>

We are definitely thinking outside the box, and we see more opportunity ahead. I want to back up for a second and just said how particularly proud I am of the work that we have done. I think to drive cash flow and to maintain
the balance of our -- or the strength, I should say, of our balance sheet. This has been a tough and challenging macroeconomic environment, and to come through where we are is something I think we are all proud of.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">A big part of that has been the tight working capital management, I think. We have -- Don mentioned how accounts receivable and inventory balances are down versus prior year. But even if you back up, looking at the last decade, our business model and our operational discipline is really what has enabled us to generate the kind of cash flows
that you have seen.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we have proven that we can do that in good times and in bad times. So as a result, and this is more to your question, I think we are confident that we can invest in both new and existing businesses to create some more long-term value, and increase, as you have said, the cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.</font></div>

we are seeing improvement there.</font></div>

So when the revenues are as soft as they are, the profitability is a little bit more challenging. But over time we believe, just like a lot of the other less-developed markets, the middle class is growing. We feel great about where our distribution
is headed, where the product is, where the brand strength is. So I absolutely think that market is going to come back to growth. And as the topline starts moving again, I think we're going to see the bottom line move along very nicely as well.</font></div>

I think we feel very, very confident that that marketplace still possesses all of the passion and interest in the world of sports that it has demonstrated over the last
several years. And has been one of the foundational pieces of the growth that we saw during the past four or five year. So we think that is still there. And the consumer is still telling us that we have a strong brand and a very, very strong position in the marketplace.</font></div>

Just quickly on the gross margin, I guess where was the real surprise? You sort of talked about a slight positive to the margin side, where was the real delta there? And I guess I'm surprised that you wouldn't
see even greater expansion, maybe in the fourth quarter, given currency probably turning to more of a benefit.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Well, first of all, I think we have talked about this many times before. There is a lot of macro factors in margin, as well as things that we control. Our guidance says, as you pointed out, is pretty significant year-over-year improvement in the
fourth quarter, but not quite at the level of the third quarter.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">One of the things in the macro space that has been a key driver for us this year is raw material costs and freight. Both of those have been pretty low. As we have said before, there is a bit of a lag on that, probably six to twelve months, so we are looking at cost structures really that were essentially dictated by fairly slack demand and
excess capacity about a year ago. So that is starting to turn now. And I think we're going to start to see a little bit more headwind out of raw material and freight costs.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Currency, as you pointed out, it has been a modest headwind. Part of that is on a lag as well. We did a pretty aggressive hedging program about two years ago when the euro was up in the $1.50s. That was a very good thing, and actually as a result we didn't really take the full hit on the weakening euro in fiscal '10. That has really been bleeding
in over probably the last six months, and it is going to hit us a little bit more into next fiscal year.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So there are a couple of factors that had been positive in FY 10 that are going to turn into a little bit more headwind. Having said that, one of the things we are really very thrilled about is the stuff that we do control. Charlie and Mark both talked about apparel, where we have done some really good work in terms of streamlining the product
line. We continue to work on lean manufacturing, raw material consolidation. Those things are all driving benefits in fiscal 10, and we think they will into '11 as well.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our owned retail, we have all spoken to that today. The margins in owned retail have been fantastic. That is both a commentary on cleaner inventories, as well as more sophistication in terms of how we price product in the stores, and also the strength of our brand.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we feel great about those factors, and we think those continue into 2011. So the outlook for margin, I think we are going to see a little more macroeconomic pressure as we go forward, but a lot of the things we are doing internally are really paying dividends, and we feel great about those continuing into the future.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Tom Shaw&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Alright, thanks for that color. And a quick question on running. A pretty sharp change of pace here from 3Q to the orders plus 30% in the fourth quarter. I guess maybe -- is it really the Lunar product that is driving that? And also how do you look
at maybe some of the strategic changes that Foot Locker is going through with how they are positioning their merchandising?</font></div>

I think the Lunar product is definitely a big part of that. I think the work that we have put in and R&amp;D and the innovation that we have introduced over the last six months is really starting to take hold. I think that you're seeing
the running silhouette continue to be the silhouette of choice in a lot of the different markets around the world. But with that, I also say that our basketball product continues to get better and better as well.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So what I like to see is the fact that we are doing well in both the basketball and the running silhouette from a casual standpoint. And then I think the performance positioning in running continues to get sharper and sharper for us. And we are seeing the benefit of that coming out of the running specialty account.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">With regards to the Foot Locker announcement and position, we feel great that they're taking a larger interest in running. A healthy Foot Locker goes a long way in being a healthy brand in the United States. Their ability to look at multiple categories at a heightened way is something we are pretty excited about.</font></div>

We are very much in line in terms of that strategy. They continue to focus on basketball. I
think Ken Hicks talked about NIKE's relationship in terms of House of Hoops and its success there. But we think any steps that they take to differentiate and segment their banners is really good for Foot Locker and good for NIKE.</font></div>

A single question. Can I ask you to speak in more detail about the role you see owned retail playing in your growth strategy? Should we expect owned retail to increase materially as a percent of the overall mix?
And maybe if you could provide a little color by geography that would be helpful as well.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;I will just take it overall. We have been very vocal about our commitment to becoming a better retailer, not from the standpoint of making direct retail a significantly higher percentage of our business, but I think to lift our entire business
and our ability or our potential as a company to grow and create a more exciting experience for the consumer at point of sale.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we are doing that, obviously, through our own doors. We are doing that through our wholesale partners with some of the concepts that you have seen, House of Hoops, for example, the work we are doing with Finish Line, with Dick's, other key retail partners.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Then I think you'll see more of that continue -- and likewise online. Some of the work we are doing online to better connect with consumers, and make that whole commerce experience, I think -- or brand experience with NIKE that much more compelling.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So I firmly believe, and I have said this many times, and I will probably say it many more, is that our ability to become a better retailer is going to help us become a better company with a lot more potential, and really ultimately become a better wholesale partner as well.</font></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt">
<br></div>
<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> I will just pick it up in the geography piece. Because it does differ from one geography to another, and it does differ from an in-line versus a factory store footprint as well. So in the United States we have a very large factory footprint, and an increasing
in-line footprint. In most other geographies we are actually reversed.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And then you get the difference from a consumer standpoint, which they don't really see the difference, what is owned and what is actually a partner door, and we break it down. I would just say that we are going to spend a lot more time on this, breaking this down when we get to the investor day in May. I would probably just reserve any further
comment on how it breaks down until then.</font></div>
