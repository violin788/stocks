Welcome to Nike's fiscal 2013 first quarter conference call. For those who need to reference today's press release you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, and discounts which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s business including equipment, NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley, and Umbro are not included in these futures numbers.</font></div>

Wholesale equivalent sales include both reported revenue and estimations of sales by licensees based on the royalties paid. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at Nike&#8217;s website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">NIKE, Inc. first-quarter revenues were up 10%, with constant currency growth across nearly all geographies, categories and brands.&#160;&#160;Excluding currency changes, our revenues were up 15%, fueled by double-digit growth in the Nike Brand and Converse. That&#8217;s incredible growth in any environment and even more remarkable given the volatile global economy.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We expected Earnings per Share to be lower than last year, and they were - down 10% to $1.23.&#160;&#160;&#160;Gross margins fell about 80 basis points, but that&#8217;s slightly better than we expected and sequentially better than Q4.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">And in line with our plan, SG&amp;A expenses were higher &#8211; up 18% as we invested in a remarkable array of product innovations and inspiring moments over the Summer of Sport.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A solid start to the year &#8211; and a huge quarter for NIKE innovation.&#160;&#160;And that&#8217;s important, because in a challenging global economy and marketplace, innovation is one way companies sustain growth and build separation.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 2008 we came off the Beijing Olympics with a pipeline of innovation that had the potential to define performance and style for years to come. We talked about technologies like Lunar, Flywire, Free and ultra-light high-performance apparel. We said they could deliver growth by expanding across categories and brands. And we&#8217;ve seen that happen.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Now in 2012, I&#8217;m telling you again &#8211; we come off our Summer of Sport with a pipeline of innovation that has the potential to define performance and style for years to come.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">First came the European Football Championships. It&#8217;s the biggest event in global football outside of the World Cup. NIKE had five teams wearing kits that delivered the absolute standard in performance and sustainability.&#160;&#160;We created four unique boots, each one matched to a specific style of play. And their unique, color-block design made them instantly recognizable by record crowds in the stadiums and around the world.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our message was:&#160;&#160;Be fast. Be seen. And we were. That energy translates directly to consumers. Replica sales are strong, and cleated footwear alone is up double-digits in Western Europe. That&#8217;s what happens when product, brand and distribution all line up. It was a great start to the Summer of Sport.</font></div>

Close to a million people squeezed into 14 acres of sand along Huntington Beach.&#160;&#160;It&#8217;s really an exhibition of how we leverage the NIKE, Hurley and Converse brands to connect with people and create energy in Action Sports &#8211; something we&#8217;ll continue to do as we develop new products and experiences to support this key category in the future.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Then came the Olympics in London. I&#8217;ve been to just about every major sporting event, and there&#8217;s really nothing that compares to the Olympics. Everything gets amplified. Athletes are more focused. Fans are more excited. Nations a little prouder. And expectations are sky high. Yet somehow the athletes and drama exceeded what anyone thought possible. That&#8217;s the infinite possibility of sports.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We worked with more than 100 sports federations from around the world. 3,000 Olympic athletes wore the Swoosh in competition, on the medal stand and around the Olympic Village. And they won more than 160 medals, 59 of them gold. More than 400 track-and-field athletes competed in those brightly colored NIKE Volt flats and spikes. And at retail, the products worn by our athletes became &#8220;must haves&#8221; for consumers.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It&#8217;s also important to note the increasing participation by women in the Olympics. Every national team included at least one female athlete &#8212; a first for the Olympics. Overall 44% of the athletes in London were women. That&#8217;s good for sports, and it&#8217;s good for Nike.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Innovation is what fuels the power of our portfolio. Our brands and categories - along with our operations and partnerships and talent &#8211; give us the leadership position we need to compete globally. And that diversity helps us win in the most important world markets.&#160;&#160;It allows NIKE to leverage the strengths in one area of the business, while making investments in other areas, to drive sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.&#160;&#160;These investments include supporting key product innovations, consumer experiences and retail executions &#8211; and of course, our efforts to transform the marketplace for the NIKE Brand.&#160;&#160;One of the critical markets we&#8217;re investing in for growth is China, and I&#8217;d like to spend a minute on that.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">At the same time, China is moving toward a more consumer-focused economy. Over the long term, we think this trend is good for Nike. As more Chinese consumers have significant disposable income and demand more premium products and presentation, global brands like Nike who are delivering on those demands are winning. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re taking decisive action to ensure the relevance of our products, the power of our brands, and the health and potential of the marketplace to deliver significant growth that is sustainable and profitable over the long-term.</font></div>

What is certain is that China offers more opportunity for NIKE today than it ever has. And I am completely committed to extending our leadership position there.</font></div>

The athletes - and the Nike products they competed in - created one of the most compelling Olympic Games in recent memory. Those amazing performances translate directly to the running consumer &#8211; and that drives growth. Q1 is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Running category, and our Running business is now 50% bigger than it was 2 years ago. We also saw our Women&#8217;s Running business outpace our Men&#8217;s business this quarter - a great indication that we&#8217;re continuing to realize our huge opportunity across the broader women&#8217;s business. And we&#8217;re not letting up. Nike Plus continues to gather momentum with over 8 million registered users. It was a strong quarter and more to come from our running team.</font></div>

We have a name for that strategy - we call it Amplify Sport. Nobody can do it at the level we do it. I really believe it&#8217;s one of our biggest competitive advantages, and it&#8217;s key to connecting with consumers, building capacity and demand for our brand throughout the marketplace. What we&#8217;re doing in North America with innovative product, strong brand connectivity, and premium distribution informs the strategies we use to grow around the world.</font></div>

And it has been for some time. Part of that is due to a growing middle class and its insatiable appetite for sport.&#160;&#160;But a bigger growth driver is how NIKE capitalizes on that opportunity by really understanding the consumer through the category approach. In Q1 we saw growth in every category, led by our efforts in Running, Football, and Sportswear.</font></div>

Our EBIT margin was up - even after some significant investments in the Euro Champs and Olympics - and Futures are up. And there&#8217;s more opportunity for us to align more closely with our retail partners across the region to improve merchandise assortments and in-store presentation.&#160;&#160;That said, there are still a lot of questions on currency and debt.

They want clearer choices, more innovation and better services tailored to them.&#160;&#160;At the same time, the economy is slowing, creating short-term impacts for any company doing business there.&#160;&#160;Certainly retailers are seeing profit challenges as the industry works to absorb excess inventory.&#160;&#160;Some choppy waters for sure.</font></div>

We&#8217;re also bringing a more balanced assortment of performance and sportswear offerings to the market. More than ever, they expect the same level of high performance products that consumers around the world demand.&#160;&#160;I feel good about our progress here, and we&#8217;re sharpening our product focus at every level.</font></div>

What I can tell you is that I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;re taking the right actions here, as we work with our retail partners to re-set the marketplace. The successes we&#8217;re seeing in North America and our progress in Western Europe reflect our ability to understand the consumer through the category offense and the strategic investments we&#8217;ve made against the biggest growth opportunities.

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">First, that our portfolio lets us leverage our innovation and brand strength to attack commercial opportunities across multiple dimensions.&#160;&#160;You saw that reflected in our Q1 results, as our brand strength and past innovations drove powerful revenue growth across categories, geographies and product types.&#160;&#160;And you&#8217;ll see it in our future results, as we fully commercialize this year&#8217;s brand stories and innovations, such as Flyknit and Digital Sport.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Second, that the diversity of our portfolio and the strength of our balance sheet allow us to more effectively manage risk.&#160;&#160;As we face pressures in one part of our business, we&#8217;re well positioned to manage the impact of those pressures over time while leveraging the stronger parts of our portfolio to drive solid near term profitability.</font></div>

So we think what you'll see for fall of -- what you saw for fall of 2012 and into holiday of 2012 and then onto the spring and summer is not as much of an across-the-board type of price movement as you saw in the last couple of seasons, but a lot more style-by-style, product-by-product price increase. So we do expect, over time, we're going to see more pricing certainly in the next few years than what we saw over the last 10. But you're not going to see the same kind of across-the-board price that we saw in the last couple of seasons.</font></div>

Well, I think, certainly, our ability to flow and merchandise the products into the retail marketplace is something we're really focused on. Retail productivity and profitability is a major focus going forward. I think it's paramount in the execution of the Sportswear strategy. With that said, continuing to balance the offering between performance and Sportswear is really where we're ultimately headed. I think something else that we've realized is continuing to really tailor a specific fit for the Chinese consumer is important, especially in the apparel side of the business and we're working on that. So we're still very bullish, long-term, on the opportunity, whether it's from the Sportswear side or the performance side. I think as we've said many times on the way, this -- the Amplify Sport approach, where we really build the brand off of our core performance positioning and leverage that into the Sportswear arena is the way that we will attack the Chinese market just like we do the rest of the world.</font></div>

I guess the first question is, it was obviously noticeable how strong the total revenue growth was versus the futures number, constant currency, put up last quarter. Any thoughts on that 15% global comp gain, sort of what drove it this quarter and why or why wouldn't that continue going forward? That was one question. And just a follow-up on China, can you give us a little more color on what the futures -- that minus 6 China futures? Is it Sportswear futures are down big in China but technical footwear is up or in technical apparel is up or flat? Or just sort of some color on if there's a pretty dramatic difference between sort of your Sportswear business in China in the outlook and whether you're actually growing the higher price point technical product.</font></div>

Robbie, it's Charlie. Let me take the comp store number first. I think what you saw was an incredibly strong brand and some incredibly strong product coming out of the DTC numbers. A lot of that number was being driven out of the North American marketplace, the -- it's weighted where we saw a huge success in the North American marketplace and something that I think is indicative of our ability to continue to drive our -- both our brand and the business forward as we think about that. And with regard to the 6% number in China, it's really relatively balanced across both Footwear and apparel and Sportswear and performance. I would say that Sportswear numbers are a little bit -- I mean, the -- excuse me, the performance numbers are a little bit stronger. And I would also add that it's our goal right now to manage the supply into that marketplace. I mean, one of the things that we've always talked about is the strength of the brand in the marketplace and creating a pull market and making sure that our supply and demand ratios are intact. Right now, we have an overabundance of supply and we need to manage that as we continue to drive demand.</font></div>

The other thing that's really powering our DTC business is really stronger operations. Those store operations are getting better and better. And Charlie referenced this earlier in terms of our learning that we can deploy back into the wholesale business as well. But our DTC operations are becoming more and more productive on a door basis, and that's also helping fuel the comps.</font></div>

Charlie, on the China futures number, it's down 6%, not -- obviously not a number that we all like seeing. But the local Chinese brands are putting up much worse numbers than that and look to be under much greater pressure in the Chinese market than your brand is. Can you give us a sense on what the kind of market share opportunity is for you? Some -- a lot of the partners you work with also work with these Chinese brands that are really getting killed over there. Can you just give us a sense on how you think that could play to your advantage?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Charlie Denson&gt;:</font> Yes, well, I think, I mean, you're right, Robbie. I mean, you bring that up. I think the competitive landscape right now for us on the long term -- actually, we're pretty -- we feel good about because to your point, a lot of the local brands have really struggled and have continued to show an inability to figure out how to go forward. I think that offers up longer term some great market share opportunity for us. In the near term though, it really -- with the discounted products from all the brands in the marketplace, it tends to throw some of the market share numbers off a little bit depending on who's discounting the heaviest and who's moving, trying to move the most inventory. But that being said, I do see a consolidation in that marketplace. We've seen it time and time again around the world as markets develop, and I think you're going to see some of that in China as well. But we still believe that, that market has a ton of growth left in it. And I don't want to let that get away from any of these conversations, that it's still a very, very big growth opportunity for the NIKE Brand.</font></div>

I'm going to jump in here. The strength of the category offense that you're seeing more in full bloom here in North America, it really represents the huge opportunity in China over the long term. So we have the strongest offering of product across the categories, across product types than we've ever had as a company in large part due to the focus we've had by category. And as we leverage that position more effectively in China, I think you're going to see that competitive advantage of NIKE actually extend itself.</font></div>

What happened -- what do you think you might have misread in China as to sort of the speed of change?

It's like I said. I think we've said it in the prepared remarks as well in a sense that we have been talking about this for probably the last 6 months, 6 to 12 months. I think the pace from which it has accelerated, I would say, maybe caught us a little off guard. That being said, I really feel good about the direction that we're headed. I think back to what Mark just talked about, our ability to differentiate our distribution network and create differentiation in the marketplace, which ultimately creates capacity. I think 2 -- or 1 of the other things that we certainly didn't see coming was the slowdown economically and what the impact that might be having. We don't look at that as an excuse. And we, in a lot of ways, look at that as an opportunity because I think it does shake out the marketplace. And I think you're going to see some consolidation. And I think that benefits us.</font></div>

I believe much of the question was answered before. Do you see -- how much of a divergence do you see between the -- like the acceptance of NIKE Footwear in China versus apparel? I mean, my impression in talking to a lot of people is that it's almost like almost 2 separate brands right now in that the Footwear has been extremely well accepted. It stands more apart from maybe more the other at least. The consumer doesn't maybe understand it apart from the other rather than the apparel. I wonder if you could just...</font></div>

I think, I mean -- I think certainly, your points are probably fair. I mean, obviously, the brand; the Footwear product has the capacity to really be more. I mean, as much as we feel great about the innovations we've introduced on the performance side of Footwear, a lot of it are just pretty cool looking. And in China, it's certainly resonating with the consumer. And I think that's why we continue to have some pretty good success on the Footwear side. And I think the apparel side is a little bit different in a sense that, that consumer is not as developed or sophisticated as a consumer in the western marketplaces, like Western Europe or U.S. That being said, they're getting there very quickly, which again plays into why we feel so confident long term that we've got the right offense and that we're posed to continue to grow in the long term. I think once we get through a little bit of this inventory issue on the apparel side and continue to work through the retail productivity opportunities; we're going to be in good shape.</font></div>

A lot of the advancement we're going to be making in apparel, I believe, is executing the fundamentals better. Charlie mentioned getting the fit more tailored to the Chinese consumer. We're doing that. And some of the early sell-throughs we're seeing there are actually quite impressive, and then actually just making a more directed assortment for our retail partners as well. So we see an opportunity there, just basically executing the fundamentals of the apparel business even better and then helping our retailers become more productive in that segment.</font></div>

The price increases that you've been putting through so far, have you been seeing any resistance at the consumer level, at the retail level?

There have been maybe a couple of styles. But overall, we're very happy with -- I mean, as you can see, the revenue numbers continue to go well. The unit numbers continue to climb. And so we're seeing some very strong brand strength and performance in sell-through at retail. And I think -- obviously, I think most everybody is doing their store checks and checking our sell-through rate. Certainly, here in the U.S., we have seen very little resistance to the price. So we are still very confident. And then I'll just go back to what Don talked a little bit earlier. It's just continuing to look at this opportunity case by case, from geography to geography, from category to category and really continuing to sharpen our ability to take price where we feel we have the opportunity and not to where we're taking advantage or we're going to get hurt on the revenue line.</font></div>

We're certainly looking at those opportunities, and I think you hit it. The innovation that we have coming in the pipeline, I think, is going to demand some premium pricing. We're very happy, as Charlie said, with the leverage that we've created, with the price increases that we've had.

Well, first of all, I'm very bullish on Flyknit, as I've been publicly stating since the very beginning there. From a performance standpoint, obviously, from a sustainability standpoint, incredible innovation that has the potential to really significantly, over time, decrease our product cost while we increase the performance. And we can do some things from a performance standpoint that are extraordinary. I mean, what we're seeing in the first stages of Flyknit is just sort of the tip of the iceberg. Some of the successive generations that we're already working on are incredibly impressive. And I say that not only as the CEO but as a shoe dog. Yes, I'm not surprised that we've got some imitation going on in the marketplace or attempted innovation. We expect to see that, but we'll defend our position certainly. It's very important to us.</font></div>

I don't have that to hand, but what I will tell you on an aggregate basis, the constant-dollar futures are balanced.

So I'd rather leave it to that in terms of providing that information. I think, as Charlie said, one of the things that is creating the speed with which the situation is developing is that we are managing it assertively. We do have good visibility into the channel. It's not perfect. But in China, we have pretty good visibility into the channel and when we see it building up, we're going to take action on that. And that's one of the reasons why we&#8217;re going to be managing our futures. So I'd say we're -- it's going to take us some time to work our way through this, but we have reasonable visibility and we're going to take the actions we need to, to clear out the market -- clear out the channel.</font></div>
