<P align="left"><FONT size="2">PAMELA CATLETT<br>
Director of Investor Relations
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Good afternoon, everyone. We&#146;re pleased you&#146;re joining us this afternoon to
discuss Nike&#146;s fiscal 2004 first quarter results. We&#146;re going to keep our
streamlined approach to our review of the results. For those of you who need to
reference our release, you&#146;ll find it on our website at
www.nikebiz.com/investor. You&#146;ll also find expanded information on the website
about some of the highlights we&#146;ll be discussing today.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Participants in today&#146;s call are Charlie Denson and Mark Parker, Co-Presidents
of the Nike Brand, and Don Blair, Nike&#146;s Chief Financial Officer. Each of
today&#146;s participants will provide brief prepared remarks and then we&#146;ll answer
your questions.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Before I turn it over to Don Blair, let me remind you that on this call we&#146;re
going to make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, and
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are
detailed in the reports we file with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and
the 10-K. Some forward-looking statements concern futures orders that are not
necessarily indicative of total revenues for subsequent periods due to
cancellations and the mix of futures and at-once orders, which may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it&#146;s important to remember
a significant portion of our business including equipment; most of Nike Retail,
Nike Golf, Cole Haan, Bauer, and Hurley are not included in these futures
numbers.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">During this conference call we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A
presentation of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can
also be found at Nike&#146;s website, again www.nikebiz.com. In this call we may
also discuss non-public financial and statistical information, which is also
publicly available on that site.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Now here&#146;s Don Blair.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">DONALD W. BLAIR<br>
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Thanks Pam. In a number of ways the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was very
gratifying, as we saw the benefits of many of the initiatives we&#146;ve undertaken
in recent years.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Our revenues grew 8% in the quarter, in line with our long-term goal of high
single-digit growth. As a result of the growth in our international businesses
over the last several years, we were in a great position to benefit from the
significant strengthening of currencies outside the US. In the quarter, our
international regions delivered 15% revenue growth versus the prior year and
once again reported more revenue than the U.S. region.
</FONT>

<P align="center"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;</FONT>

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Our quarterly pretax profit margin exceeded 13% for the first time since the
first quarter of 1998. This was driven by a consolidated gross margin of 43%,
up 160 basis points versus the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and the highest in
recent history. This performance was particularly encouraging, since the
stronger euro accounted for only about forty basis points of this improvement
and there was no net impact from other currency movements. In other words,
higher in-line pricing margins and the positive effects of a tighter supply
chain and cleaner inventories drove 75% of the improvement. Our diluted
earnings per share for the quarter at $.98 grew 21% versus the prior year,
adjusted for last year&#146;s accounting change.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We raised our return on invested capital to almost 22%, up over five points
versus the prior year and again the highest level since 1997. Over the last
several years, we&#146;ve invested a significant amount of capital and operating
expense in our supply chain, both in our distribution facilities in the US,
Europe, and Asia, as well as improved systems and processes. In this quarter,
you can see that we&#146;re now effectively leveraging that infrastructure both in
terms of higher gross margins and higher returns on capital.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We continued to generate strong cash flows and to deliver quite a bit of that
cash back to shareholders. For the quarter, we repurchased $95&nbsp;million of stock
and paid out $37&nbsp;million in dividends.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">So let&#146;s get behind the numbers a bit:
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In our Europe Middle East Africa Region, which we call EMEA, revenues grew 17%
in the first quarter with nearly nineteen points of growth driven by the
stronger Euro. For the quarter, reported footwear revenues grew 20% and
equipment revenues advanced 24%. Apparel was up 10%.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Our gross margins expanded in EMEA by 210 basis points versus the prior year,
and that accounted for 70 basis points of our consolidated margin improvement.
As we expected, the stronger euro was a key factor, driving 130 basis points of
the improvement in EMEA. Higher product margins and leverage of our
distribution infrastructure also contributed to the improvement, partially
offset by lower in-line apparel margins due to a shift in product mix.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Overall, Q1 pretax income for the EMEA region advanced 26% to $205&nbsp;million. As
in the past, our segment disclosure of regional pretax income is currently
available on our website.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In the Asia Pacific Region, our business continued to grow strongly in the
first quarter. Revenues increased 13% for the quarter, with about four points
of the increase coming from stronger currencies in the region. For the quarter,
footwear reported 12% growth, while apparel grew 15% and equipment advanced
13%. Revenues grew in nearly every country in the region.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">For the quarter, Asia Pacific gross margins increased eighty basis points,
accounting for ten basis points of the gross margin improvement for Nike, Inc.
The Asia Pacific margin increase was largely the result of higher in-line
margins across footwear, apparel, and equipment. Reported Q1 pretax income for
the Asia Pacific Region grew 51% to $77&nbsp;million.

<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In the Americas Region, revenues grew 8% for the quarter, with a little over
two points of the increase coming from currency effects in the region. For the
quarter, footwear reported 11% growth, while apparel grew 2% and equipment
advanced 5%. On a country basis, the revenue increase was driven by strong
growth in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, while sales in Canada and Mexico were
essentially flat.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">For the quarter, gross margins in the Americas region fell 140 basis points,
reducing the consolidated Nike gross margin by ten basis points. Less favorable
hedge rates in Mexico and South America accounted for 100 basis points of the
regional gross margin decline.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Reported Q1 pretax income for the Americas region fell slightly to $24&nbsp;million.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In the U.S. Region, we continued to grow profits while realigning sales and
distribution. Although revenues for the quarter declined 2%, pretax profits
grew 4%. Gross margins for the quarter reached 43.7%, up 210 basis points
versus the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and driving a ninety-basis-point
improvement in Nike Inc.&#146;s consolidated gross margin. Over half of the region&#146;s
gross margin expansion came from higher wholesale footwear margins, with the
balance contributed by higher gross margins in wholesale apparel and equipment,
and Nike Retail. SG&#038;A spending for the region grew slightly, as demand creation
increased at a low single-digit rate and overhead spending declined.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">U.S. footwear sales declined 5% in the quarter, as sales to Foot Locker
declined 34% while sales to other accounts advanced 2%. About half of the
overall decline was due to a lower average selling price per pair. U.S. apparel
revenues rose 5% in the quarter, as growth in performance apparel and licensed
product more than offset lower sales of active life apparel.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Nike-owned retail continued to perform well in the U.S., as the strength of the
brand and improving store operations drove a 7% comp store sales increase for
August and for the first quarter.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Revenues from our other businesses grew 32% for the quarter. Coming off the
challenges of last year, Nike Golf revenues grew over 40% for the quarter,
Bauer Nike Hockey and Hurley each advanced about 30%, and our Cole Haan
business posted 14% growth for the quarter. For the first quarter, which tends
to be the smallest revenue quarter of the year for these businesses, our other
businesses reported a $3&nbsp;million pretax loss, $8&nbsp;million better than last year.
Better bottom-line results at Nike Golf, Cole Haan, and Bauer Nike Hockey drove
the improvement.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Consolidated SG&#038;A spending grew 8% in the first quarter. Six percentage points
of the increase were due to changes in exchange rates.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">For the first quarter, demand creation spending increased 1% to $324&nbsp;million,
reflecting a six-percentage point increase due to changes in currency exchange
rates. Excluding the impact of currency, our demand creation spending declined
versus the first quarter of fiscal 2003, when we were funding our World Cup
marketing campaign.
</FONT>

<P align="center"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;</FONT>

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">For the first quarter, operating overhead increased 13% to $546&nbsp;million. Nearly
three quarters of the increase came in our international regions, which grew
25% for the quarter, reflecting the stronger euro, higher reserves for bad
debts, and factory outlet store openings in Europe. Higher IT spending and
infrastructure investments in Nike Golf, Cole Haan, and Hurley accounted for
most of the remaining growth.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Now let me spend a few minutes on one of my favorite lines of the P&#038;L, Other
Income and Expense. Beginning this fiscal year, we will no longer report
interest income or profit sharing expense on the Other Income and Expense line.
Interest income will now be netted against interest expense on the face of our
income statement and profit sharing expense will be reported as a component of
operating overhead. We have adjusted the presentation of the income statements
for prior years to conform to this new classification.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Excluding these items, other expense for the quarter was $24&nbsp;million, up from
$11&nbsp;million in the first quarter of the prior year. The majority of the
year-over-year increase in other expense related to the donation of property to
the Nike Foundation and reserves for settlement of various non-operating
obligations.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">About $10&nbsp;million of this quarter&#146;s other expense and a comparable dollar
amount in the prior year were due to foreign currency losses, mostly from
Europe. These losses were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign
currency denominated profits reported by our international regions. For the
current year quarter, the effect of netting these foreign currency losses and
the favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits was $34
million of pretax income growth or about $.08 per share versus the first
quarter of fiscal 2003.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.8%, our current estimate of the
full year rate.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We&#146;re also very pleased with our working capital management during the quarter.
As of August&nbsp;31st, worldwide inventories were 4% or $56&nbsp;million higher than the
prior year. The stronger euro accounted for approximately $39&nbsp;million of
growth. Inventory in our U.S. region was flat versus the prior year.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">As of August&nbsp;31st, accounts receivable increased $53&nbsp;million or about 2.5%
versus the prior year due to the strong euro, which accounted for $81&nbsp;million
of growth. Excluding the euro impact, accounts receivable declined just over
1%.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">For the quarter, we generated $351&nbsp;million of cash flow from operations and
used $42&nbsp;million of cash by investing activities. Cash provided by financing
activities, including $95&nbsp;million of share repurchases and $162&nbsp;million of net
borrowings, totaled $50&nbsp;million. As a result, our cash balance increased by
$364&nbsp;million during the quarter as we prepared to close the Converse
transaction in early September.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">As we entered this fiscal year, we told you that we expected to report
full-year results broadly in line with the financial model we&#146;ve articulated
before: high single-digit revenue growth, expanding gross margins, and
mid-teens earnings per share growth. Certainly our first quarter results give
us additional confidence that we can achieve those goals.

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We do believe we can deliver high single-digit revenue growth this year. Today
we reported a 10.5% increase in futures orders for the next five months. It is
important to recognize that this order growth reflects a change in the timing
of our Spring orders in Europe. We will begin shipping some Spring product in
January 2004, a month earlier than in 2003. At this point, we estimate that
this change resulted in a four- to five-percentage-point increase in our
futures order growth for this release. Nevertheless, these orders represent a
significant acceleration of our futures trend over the last several quarters,
particularly in the second half of the futures window.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In addition as you recall, revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2003
was stronger than normal and the third quarter weaker than normal, as we pulled
shipments forward in advance of our supply chain implementation in Europe. When
you work through all of the ins and outs, we expect revenue growth in the mid
single-digit range for quarters two and four, with mid-teens growth in the
third quarter.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Our first quarter gross margin performance also increases our confidence in
achieving our full-year goals. We do not expect to see the same absolute gross
margin percentage over the balance of the year. Generally our gross margin
percentage is highest in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, due
to seasonal product mix and leverage on fixed costs. Hence we expect to see
lower gross margin percentage in the second and third quarters than in the
quarter we just concluded. However, we do expect to see year-over-year growth
in gross margin and pretax profit margins for the full year.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">So overall, even with the strong results we&#146;ve posted for Q1, we still expect
accelerated earnings per share growth in the second half of the year. The
second quarter remains our most difficult growth comparison. In addition to the
revenue timing discussed earlier, our SG&#038;A was relatively low as we scaled back
demand creation spending following the World Cup last year. For this year&#146;s Q3,
the comparisons will ease and we should see stronger earnings per share growth
versus the prior year.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In summary, we&#146;re very pleased with our results so far this year and we feel
we&#146;re in a great position to continue to deliver solid profit growth over the
balance of fiscal 2004.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">With that, I&#146;ll turn the floor over to Mark Parker.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">MARK PARKER<br>
President, Nike Brand
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Thanks Don. I&#146;m sure none of you will be surprised to hear that I am very
pleased with the numbers that we are reporting today. What today&#146;s results are
telling us is that the Nike brand is strong, that our products are right with
consumers and that our brand communications are resonating both here in the
United States and around the world all helping to really drive our business
performance.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">During the year-end earnings call in June, I mentioned that much of our success
in fiscal year &#146;03 was due to our running a more complete offense &#151; delivering
great product across the

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">performance sport categories into Active Life and Classic product and up and
down the price spectrum . . . across the Regions and around the world.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We&#146;re continuing that momentum into quarter one of the current fiscal year. For
example, in the U.S. Nike delivered nine of the top ten selling footwear models
for July according to the most recent NPD data. In Apparel, Nike Teams Sports
continues to shine, with the NBA Rewind collection, still one of the hottest in
the market.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">But we couldn&#146;t sustain brand heat without having the right products that meet
or exceed consumer expectations. From a performance perspective, footwear such
as our Speed product and Nike Shox continues to generate strong energy at
retail.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Backed by an integrated marketing effort that included television, print, web,
and retail executions, Nike introduced in July the Zoom Spiridon, a lightweight
performance running shoe. It quickly became one of the fastest selling shoes at
retail and really our top selling product on nikerunning.com. The Zoom Spiridon
joins the Nike Shox NZ and Nike Shox Ride as the three top-selling running
shoes of any brand in the market, all by the way selling for $100 or more at
retail.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Just as consumers have long embraced the Nike Air Cushioning technology, the
Nike Shox platform is earning its own respect and following, as evidenced by
the highly successful launch in our Americas region of the Total Magia, the
first Nike Shox soccer shoe. We&#146;ll bring this product to the U.S. next month
and we&#146;ll continue to broaden consumers&#146; access to this advanced technology
with other Nike Shox products and in new categories.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In addition to these great performance product highlights, we also enjoyed
solid results in our core businesses of running, basketball and cross-training.
Our cross-training business saw improvement with the success of the Air Monarch
&#151; a clean, white leather shoe that NPD says is the top selling cross-trainer
in the industry today &#151; having sold more than 1.2&nbsp;million pair year-to-date.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">At the same time, we&#146;ve seen success in our Active Life segment showing that
our product is resonating both on and off the fields of play. For example, the
Haze Dunk was a very limited quantity product, another example of collaborating
with artists and designers. This product sold out literally within hours. And a
couple of weeks ago, we hosted an exclusive event in New York to launch a
limited collection of &#147;Laser&#148; etched footwear, designed to captivate and
inspire . . . the real sneaker heads or sneaker aficionados . . . from around
the world.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We&#146;re continuing to see our Active Life footwear business grow even stronger
and build on that momentum while, at the same time, we stay fixated on further
extending our performance leadership position.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Not only did Nike generate excitement in the marketplace, but it also drove
profitability, contributing to our highest single quarter gross margin
performance in recent history. After several quarters of decline and then
stabilization, we&#146;re encouraged by the positive average price growth we&#146;ve seen
in both footwear and apparel futures.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Overall gross margins of 43% were a 160 basis point improvement over the first
quarter of our fiscal 2003, and a 150 basis point improvement since our last
quarter&#146;s performance. Gross margins for Nike Brand Footwear were up 200 basis
points from last year, contributing 100 basis points to total gross margin
improvement, as we enjoy the euro strength and continue to improve our
execution in delivering our products to market.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Nike&#146;s Apparel business in the first quarter was driven by innovation,
continued momentum in team sports, performance apparel and the strength of our
women&#146;s collections in every region.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Once again Nike created history through innovation with the launch of the Swift
Spin technology at the Tour de France, helping Lance Armstrong ride to his very
exciting and inspiring fifth consecutive Tour de France win. At the recent U.S.
Tennis Open we provided our athletes with great technology and style that
generated tremendous consumer interest in the sleeveless Nike Sphere shirt and
the Cool Motion dresses, which then translated into strong sell-throughs of our
product at retail.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">NIKE Team Sports has been a great success story, and this quarter was no
exception. This Fall we will continue to dominate college Football. Not only
the top ten, but 22 out of the top 25 teams are Nike partner schools. At retail
we have just launched a collection called &#147;tradition defined&#148;, celebrating ten
years of our college football affiliation by bringing back replica product from
our top teams. The response has been very positive.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">And NBA Rewind continues to be one of the hottest products in the marketplace,
as the consumer&#146;s demand for high-quality vintage replica jerseys shows no sign
of slowing down.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In addition to football and basketball, Nike Team Sports obtained the rights to
market vintage Major League Baseball product under the &#147;Cooperstown
Collection.&#148; This collection will add to the momentum that our Team Sports
division is building in MLB as indicated by the recent expanded licensing
rights beginning January&nbsp;1, 2005.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">But Team Sports is not just a U.S. business. Europe Team Sports also enjoyed
strong sales with the successful launch of the Juventus kit and continued
growth of our Manchester United business.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Our global Women&#146;s business in the first quarter was particularly strong, and
our sell-through at retail continues to reflect consumer demand for our
product. The women&#146;s-focused campaigns as well as the new shadow campaign
showcase our Women&#146;s product and have contributed to our strong sell-through
momentum. In the U.S. our women&#146;s business in all channels is strong, with the
newly revamped and younger attitude Silver Label collections achieving the high
sell-through that we consistently see in our performance collections. Response
to our Spring line was great, and the new Summer collection has had the
strongest response to any women&#146;s line yet.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In our International markets, the Americas region mirrors the U.S. with our new
women&#146;s stores in Canada and Argentina performing extremely well. In Asia, the
success of the Women&#146;s &#147;Own

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">the Gym&#148; campaign has resulted in an increase in the sell-through of women&#146;s
training product with particular success in Total Conditioning and Workout.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In Europe, the new concepts such as the dance-inspired Studio 71 collection
have been particularly strong, and reaction to Spring and Summer has been
excellent. The &#147;Find Yourself&#148; campaign increased our women&#146;s visibility with
impactful retail areas that showcased our product with our marketing message.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">So while the U.S. retail environment overall presents its challenges, on a
global level, we are pleased with our overall sell-through performance at
retail. We&#146;re executing on deliveries, improving margins through supply chain
management and continuing to provide differentiated product and innovation to
our consumer.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Simply put, our consumers are telling us that the product is right.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Finally, Nike&#146;s offense is really not complete without connecting our brand and
product to the needs and passions of our consumers. This quarter is a great
example of how brand momentum can drive results globally, regionally, and
locally.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">On a global level since we last spoke to you, Nike athletes have delivered
memorable performances at the Tour de France, World Swim Championships in
Barcelona, World Track &#038; Field Championships in Paris, Wimbledon, and the U.S.
Open. These events have also been great vehicles for Nike to showcase our
apparel and footwear technology in both large and small ways.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">One great example is our first global apparel campaign called &#147;Shadow,&#148; which
you can check out on the website. The campaign features Nike&#146;s performance
apparel technology and has helped to create both consumer demand and drive
sales. As a result, Nike&#146;s global performance apparel business, which makes up
over a third of the Nike&#146;s total apparel business, was up over 13% this
quarter.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">On a regional level, earlier this month, MTV aired the second annual Nike
Battlegrounds one-on-one basketball tournament, which received fantastic
ratings in the important 18-24&nbsp;year-old male demographic. In our Americas
region the Total Magia that I mentioned earlier generated record-setting
sell-through for Americas footwear, supported by a brilliant television ad
campaign that Adweek recently labeled &#147;A 60-second documentary of genius at
work.&#148;
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Then locally we continue to connect with people through unique and innovative
ways, building deeper relationships with the brand. Just in the past few weeks,
we held the Nike Soccer Curb Cup in Los Angeles, a three-on-three tournament
including music, interactive games, and skills demonstrations that were enjoyed
by over 4,000 soccer-crazy L.A. youth. We had over 20,000 runners participate
in the 3rd annual NIKE Run London 10K race.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">As I said at the outset, the reasons we are here today looking at strong and
encouraging numbers are really simple:

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nike brand is strong.

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brand communications are resonating.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">With that, let me pass it over to Charlie.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">CHARLES D. DENSON<br>
President, Nike Brand
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Thanks Mark. Good afternoon everyone. You&#146;ve already heard a very thorough
review of our financial results from Don, Mark has covered the brand and
product successes, so that just leaves me with a quick spin around the world
for a regional review and some thoughts about the future. I&#146;d like to spend a
few minutes talking about three points that I believe are important for you to
understand where Nike is today and what we&#146;re focusing on going forward.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">First of all, the strategy we have articulated to manage our global business
for long-term profitable growth continues to work. In the past twelve months,
we have added over $800&nbsp;million in revenue to Nike, Inc., and this quarter we
again delivered healthy pre-tax profit growth in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. We
grew our earnings per share by 21% and achieved our highest ROIC since 1997.
This quarter we&#146;ve also announced that futures orders scheduled for delivery
over the next five months advanced 10.5% versus the prior year. Yes, there is
some noise in these numbers from currency movements and the seasonal shift in
Europe. But when you strip all that out, our futures growth has still
accelerated significantly over the pace of the last five quarters.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We&#146;ve talked about how important it is to grow in the USA, but trying to grow
an unhealthy business was not something we wanted to force. We needed to figure
out how to create excitement with the consumer again. We had to understand why
the market wasn&#146;t growing, why there wasn&#146;t the excitement that it once had. In
the U.S., our focus on the consumer and an integrated approach to our product,
marketing, and distribution strategies combined to create an improving
marketplace, one that is profitable for both us and our retail partners. That
profitability is what&#146;s starting to drive some excitement back into this
business. The brand and product momentum that Mark talked about has been core
to this success, but we are also managing the business well.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">There are several components that we have concentrated on, gross margin
management, product mix, sourcing efficiencies, inventory management have all
had a positive affect on our ability to drive overall profitability for the
industry. Our distribution strategy is something we&#146;ve talked about at length
over the last year. It&#146;s our intent to continue to concentrate on how our brand
is presented to the consumer, to improve the presentation of both footwear and
apparel, partner with the new and innovative retailers that create a compelling
shopping environment, and believe that Brand building is the key to success in
this industry. Our dialogue with Footlocker Inc is on-going, they are looking
at their formats and how they might fit into where we want to go. While we
still expect our business with Foot Locker will be down for the balance of this
calendar year, futures orders from Foot Locker are up for the Spring season to
date. In addition, we have had considerable success with some of our other
retail partners, both big and small, and feel very good about the improving
condition of our brand at retail. And as a result, our US footwear
</FONT>
<P align="center"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;</FONT>

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">futures orders have grown for the first time in five quarters, and the seasonal
shift impact in the European futures numbers may be a combination of both the
shift and additional growth. We&#146;ll have to wait and see next quarter how it
shakes out. Our U.S. apparel futures are down for the quarter as we continue to
work towards quality distribution, and continue to see a growing percent to
total shift toward our licensed product that is not included in the futures
numbers.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The second point I&#146;d like to cover is Nike&#146;s international business. It grew 15
percent. We told you last quarter that FY 04 would be a great year for Nike&#146;s
Asia-Pacific region, and this quarters results certainly bear that out. China
continues to be one of the most exciting markets in the region as consumers&#146;
embrace the world of sports and Nike&#146;s footwear, apparel, and equipment
product. Last quarter we told you our China business had exceeded the $100
million mark for annual revenue and this quarter the team produced a 47% gain
for the quarter. Korea, Japan and Taiwan continue to deliver solid growth and
are great examples of where our focus in building our authentic performance
position in sports like soccer, running, baseball and basketball are a healthy
complement to our strong active life position. As the spotlight continues to
brighten on this part of the sports world in the coming years, I think we&#146;re in
a great position to continue our growth.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In Europe we&#146;re finally enjoying some of the currency benefit we&#146;ve been
waiting for. Over the last several years, as we built market share and drove
revenue growth in Europe, the impact of these gains on our consolidated results
was masked somewhat by currency pressures. As you&#146;ve seen, all of our growth in
Europe this quarter was driven by currency. It&#146;s a benefit we&#146;ve earned as we
catch our breath and position ourselves for the next phase of growth.
Nonetheless, we&#146;ve focused on building a sound business model that will allow
us to grow in the key markets around the region. This quarter, France, Iberia,
Italy-they all grew. While we have not yet seen the full turn to healthy growth
in the UK yet, the futures numbers reported today include positive growth into
the Spring season.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">We will continue to manage our portfolio for profitable growth around the
world, optimizing the components of a global business, bridging varying market
trends, economic conditions, and consumer landscapes, enabling us to continue
to deliver a healthy consistent growth to our shareholders.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Finally, I&#146;ll close with my view of Nike&#146;s abilities to lead this amazing
industry to which we belong. We feel very good about our business, our brand
strength, and the trends we&#146;re seeing in the marketplaces around the world. As
the health of the overall industry improves, we believe investment and
confidence will continue to grow. We&#146;re excited about some of the new retail
formats we&#146;re seeing in the U.S. and believe leading retailers will continue to
create fresh environments that excite consumers. We&#146;re certainly committed to
doing our part to generate that consumer excitement. Our U.S. footwear business
is starting to build positive momentum, and our international business is still
very strong-and there are still many areas where we feel we can improve our
performance.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">It&#146;s a great time of year starting this weekend. We&#146;ll see the Women&#146;s World

growing the Nike business. I&#146;ve been waiting three years for this call. Now
we&#146;ve got a strong first quarter in the books, a lot of momentum around the

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Now we&#146;ll open it up for questions. Thanks.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Margaret M. Mager with Goldman Sachs &#038; Co.:<br>
Congratulations. It&#146;s great to start the year off on a positive note. I want to
ask a couple questions. First of all about the sales growth in the quarter
being up 8% and particularly in the U.S. is a lot better than the futures
indicated. Is there something about the timing in the first quarter in the U.S.
versus the second quarter? Can you just explain that a little bit more? I heard
you say in apparel licensed is not on futures, so that probably helped that
number, so just trying to understand that. Then my second question is on the
gross margin. I believe you said, Don, that forty BPs came from favorable
currency impact. Charlie talked about mix, sourcing, and inventory management
all being factors in improving the profits. Can you just talk about how each
one of those played into gross margin improvement and how that will play out
over the balance of this year.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
With respect to the revenues, you called out the 8%. That&#146;s actually the
consolidated revenue number; that&#146;s not the U.S. number. You did identify one
of the items here. We certainly have had very good growth in the quarter from
the parts of our business that are not on futures. In addition to licensed
apparel, I&#146;d also call out some of the other businesses like Nike Golf, Cole
Haan, Bauer Nike Hockey, as well as the retail business in the U.S., which was
pretty strong. Those are some of the things that we often talk about as
reconciling items, and those were all up pretty strong for the first quarter.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">With respect to your second question, I think over the course of the year we do
expect to see about forty basis points plus. I think this is the quarter where
we have the least of the benefit. I think more of it comes a little further
back in the year. That&#146;s from a hedge rate perspective. On the translation
side, the comparisons actually get a little tougher as we get to the back half
of the year because, as you recall, in the fourth quarter we had some pretty
good euro translation rates for the fourth quarter. On the margin front, the
comparisons get a little better from foreign exchange, and on the translation
side they get a little worse. Does that answer your question?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Mager:<br>
Yes, it does with regard to currency specifically. But I guess I&#146;m trying to
understand-
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
The rest of the items?
</FONT>

<P align="center"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;</FONT>

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Mager:<br>
Yeah, the other things, how that impacted gross margins. If you can just give
us more color on what you&#146;re doing in sourcing, how the mix is impacting gross
margins, the other factors that are-
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Okay, all right. First of all, we did talk a little bit about the benefits in
our supply chain. A couple of the things that are benefiting us in margin and
supply chain is cleaner inventories, which is reducing our level of close-outs
and improving the margin on the close-out sales we do have, so that&#146;s one of
the pluses. We also are leveraging our distribution infrastructure. Over the
last couple of years, we built out a lot of our distribution infrastructure and
now we are putting more volume and more revenue through the same distribution
infrastructure, which benefits our margins. Then as far as mix is concerned,
we&#146;ve talked about some of the U.S. footwear benefits, particularly around
retro and classic product, which tends to carry a higher margin, and that was
also a benefit to the quarter.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Mager:<br>
At this juncture apparel margins versus footwear margins, rough guidance on
that? Are they comparable?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Yeah, they&#146;re comparable.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Mager:<br>
Okay, thank you.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Robby Ohmes with Banc of America Securities:<br>
A couple of quick questions. I was hoping you could tell us if you&#146;ve gotten a
little bit further thinking on what may happen with Converse over time now that
you own it. My other question was if we could get a little more clarity on
what&#146;s happening with you guys in Foot Locker. Is there sort of a move towards
them getting some of the marquee product, the $100 and over stuff that you
mentioned that&#146;s performing, the top three styles at retail?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
With respect to Converse, we just completed the final closing of the
transaction, so we haven&#146;t really put ourselves into position quite yet to
disclose all of our specific strategies. But we&#146;re obviously very excited about
adding the brand and it continues to round out some of our basketball
strategies and gives us some opportunities to do some different things. With
respect to Foot Locker, we&#146;ve continued to dialogue with them. I would say that
the dialogue is probably much healthier today than it was a year ago and that
their expectations are to get back into the marquee product zone and have
access to that product. We&#146;re working with them, but we have not set any
timelines nor have we made any changes to our distribution policies to date, so
that dialogue continues.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Ohmes:<br>
Just one last question. On the apparel side, how is the branded apparel for you
guys in the moderate channel performing?
</FONT>

<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
Well I would say it&#146;s probably one of our weakest segments, and that&#146;s one area
we think we can improve on going forward, so that&#146;s a focal point for the U.S.
apparel team.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Ohmes:<br>
Is it a delivery issue or is it just in general that the environment&#146;s weak?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
It&#146;s more the latter. I think in general the environment is weak. We&#146;re trying
to focus on our product and how we can differentiate ourselves from the
competition in that zone.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Ohmes:<br>
The issues that you talked about the last quarter you would say are pretty much
resolved.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
Yeah, they seem to be.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Parker:<br>
That&#146;s more of a USA situation.

All right, great. Thanks, guys.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Robert Drbul with Lehman Brothers:<br>
Good afternoon. Two questions. I guess can you talk about the futures orders
trends during the quarter in footwear and apparel? That&#146;d be the first one. The
second one, you finished with almost $1&nbsp;billion in cash. If you back out the
$300&nbsp;million for Converse, can you really give us an idea where you are in
terms of the dividend policy here, with share repurchase, etc.? It just seems
like the cash is really starting to build up here.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
I&#146;ll take your first question, Bob. The futures, the back half of the window is
definitely stronger than the first. I think we talked about a couple of the
reasons for that, specifically the European seasonal change, so definitely
stronger futures in the back half. With respect to the cash balance, the
Converse transaction was the acquisition, plus we also funded Converse&#146;s lines
of credit from Nike Inc. The amount of cash that we took off the balance sheet
related to the Converse transaction was a little bigger than $300&nbsp;million. But
having said that, we are certainly, as we&#146;ve discussed before, looking at all
of the deployments of our cash flow, both share repurchase as well as
dividends. At this point we&#146;re not yet prepared to talk about what changes we
may have in mind there.

Back on the futures as a follow-up, can you give us the order book ex-Foot
Locker like you did last quarter in the U.S.?

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Yeah. I think the final number, ex-Foot Locker we were up 3% in the USA.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Drbul:<br>
Okay, great. Thank you.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Jeffrey B. Edelman with UBS:<br>
Good afternoon. Nice quarter here. Don, two questions. One, would you expect
the gross margin improvement to be able to offset the SG&#038;A difficult comparison
you would expect in the second quarter?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
You know, Jeff, I&#146;d rather not get into specific discussions around a quarter
with that level of granularity. I&#146;d say for the full year the comment that I
made around full-year expectations are that we expect our operating profit
margin to improve year-over-year, which basically tells you that for the full
year I do expect gross margin improvement to offset any SG&#038;A movement.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Edelman:<br>
Okay, fine. Secondly, could you explain the discrepancy between the currency
impact in Q1 sales in the European region, which was 19%, and the impact on the
futures, which is about 7%? Is that due to mix or is that just due to the
timing in the currency?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
It&#146;s the timing in the currency.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Edelman:<br>
Okay, fine. Thank you.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Noelle V. Grainger with J.P. Morgan:<br>
Two questions if I could. First, Don, can you talk a little bit maybe more big
picture in terms of the margin and the leverage opportunity in the business
model over a longer period of time, particularly related to the infrastructure
that you&#146;ve built? What type of volume capability do you have without adding
significant incremental dollars at this point? Can you just kind of maybe
broadly address that?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Well, the approach we take with our infrastructure is we essentially go into
the proposition saying we don&#146;t want to build more footprint at this point. One
of the things we look for is ways to put more volume through the existing
footprint. We do that by managing direct shipments to customers and doing
operational stuff like cross-docking so that the agenda here for us is to try
to get as much mileage out of our existing distribution footprint as we
possibly can. At this point we believe that we do have additional opportunity
to put volume through these facilities for years. I don&#146;t know that that&#146;s five
years, ten years, but it&#146;s not next year that we think we&#146;re going to have to
build additional footprints.
</FONT>

<P align="center"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;</FONT>

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">With that said, we do have to put capital into these facilities. Some of the
capital goes in to improve the systems and make sure that we can get more
throughput through the existing buildings, bricks and mortar. I guess what I
would say to you is we don&#146;t see the need in the short term to be building
additional distribution centers, which is a big capital ticket. What we do see
is somewhat smaller investments in productivity assets that help us get more
product through the same bricks and mortar.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Grainger:<br>
Regionally is there any at this point kind of what you see on maybe the next
year horizon? Obviously Asia is going to go onto supply chain this year. I&#146;m
assuming that&#146;s still planned. Regionally, where do you see the need for the
investment?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
I think first of all with the Nike Supply Chain project we will be doing Japan
and some other parts of Asia next calendar year. It will take us a couple of
more years to actually get the systems footprint in around the world. With
respect to things like productivity investments, some of that is already going
on in the U.S., for example. We&#146;re doing some of it in Europe. Japan and Korea
are our other larger company-owned distribution centers. We&#146;re doing projects
really around the world all the time. It&#146;s just part of our ongoing capital
expenditure budget.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Grainger:<br>
My second question. I think you indicated that your sales in the U.S. in the
quarter ex-Foot Locker were up 2%, is that right?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Right.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Grainger:<br>
Can you talk a little bit about that? Is that futures or is that sales?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
No, that&#146;s sales.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Grainger:<br>
Yeah. Can you talk a little bit about that by channel?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
We don&#146;t have anything by channel in front of us, so I&#146;m really not in a
position to talk specifically by channel. I will say that we feel great about
the primary channels of distribution that we call out on a regular basis.
Athletic specialty and sporting goods, we feel great about both of those.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Actually just to clarify, Noelle, the numbers you&#146;re quoting here are footwear.
U.S. footwear sales down 34% for Foot Locker; up 2% for all the rest of the
accounts. That&#146;s just the U.S. footwear.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Grainger:<br>
What about, like, the family channel?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
I think it&#146;s still an area of opportunity for us. I think from a bookings
standpoint there&#146;s been a lot of discussion over the last six or eight months
that we were using that channel to offset some of the other business, which is
not true. We feel pretty good about the way it looks going forward. Again, we
still have seen some inventory buildup, but I double-checked this today. Any of
the buildup with regard to Nike product is minimal. We think that that is
starting to work itself through from an overall basis. That&#146;ll be an
opportunity that we&#146;re looking at for the next six to twelve months.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Grainger:<br>
Great. Thank you very much.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dennis S. Rosenberg with Credit Suisse First Boston:<br>
Hi guys. Congratulations for more than &#147;just doing it.&#148; The guidance you&#146;ve
been giving, I assume that&#146;s including Converse now. If that&#146;s true, could you
just give us a sense as to what you&#146;re expecting Converse to be contributing to
that?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Sure. For this year, Dennis, I&#146;d say in the second half of the year we expect
Converse to be a few pennies accretive. When I say that, part of the issue, as
you may know if you&#146;re a student of such things, there are a number of
accounting adjustments related to the purchase of the company that will be a
bit of a drag on earnings in the first year. That&#146;s why we think it&#146;s only
about a couple of pennies.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Rosenberg:<br>
What&#146;s the earning power once we get into the second year?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
It&#146;s tough to say. I think as Charlie said, we&#146;ve just closed this transaction
earlier this month. I guess we&#146;ve owned it for about two weeks now. While we
have a set of strategic projections in terms of what we think the business can
do, we want to spend some time working with the Converse folks to make sure we
nail that down a little more clearly before we talk about it.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Rosenberg:<br>
When you talk about second quarter sales growth of mid single digits, the
inclusion of Converse I think would probably account for 1% or 2% of that. Are
you saying that you would be up less than mid single digits just ex-Converse?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Well, mid single digits is a bit of a range, Dennis. I think at this point
Converse is a point or so, but that&#146;s not-I wouldn&#146;t use that to drive your
model in terms of what I&#146;m saying here. Our range is mid single digits, and
Converse is probably a point or two.

Another subject on the shift in Europe in futures and deliveries. Is that
something that&#146;s just affecting the Spring season or is that something that&#146;s
going to affect future periods? How should we factor that into our projections?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
No, it&#146;s just really the Spring season. It was a month shift in the launch date
of the product line.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Rosenberg:<br>
Okay, thank you.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">John T. Shanley with Wells Fargo Securities:<br>
Good afternoon and congratulations on a nice quarter, guys. I wonder if you
could drill down for us, either Don or Charlie, a little bit more on the
European numbers. I&#146;m a little confused. You said the revenues were up 17% in
the quarter but 19% of this was currency related. Does that mean on a
currency-neutral basis sales in Europe were down 2%?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
That&#146;s correct.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Shanley:<br>
Was most of that in the western part of the European market? Can you give us a
sense in terms of whether you&#146;re gaining or losing traction in terms of market
share for your footwear business in Western Europe?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
Well, I think it was pretty consistently spread over the European business and
obviously all the euro countries participated in it. I think from a
country-by-country standpoint like I called out in the prepared remarks, we saw
growth coming out of Western Europe led by Italy, France, and Spain. The U.K.
is still not quite rounded the corner yet but the futures numbers are
promising, so we&#146;re still optimistic that we&#146;re going to see some bounce-back
there. And we feel pretty good about the footwear business overall. We&#146;re still
very heavily dependent on soccer. Our soccer numbers continue to grow. I think
what I&#146;m most excited about is starting to see some of the other categories
come alive. Specifically running has always been a strong category in Europe,
but we&#146;re really starting to see basketball have an effect. Some of that is
being driven by some of the European players playing in the NBA today.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Shanley:<br>
On the U.S. front, the Foot Locker renewal that you mentioned in the 10-K,
Charlie, can you give us an idea of when that may hit in terms of quarter? Are
we going to see some of that in the second quarter or will the majority be
back-half loaded?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Catlett:<br>
I&#146;m sorry, John. What renewal?

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Shanley:<br>
There was a mention that the business with Foot Locker was likely to increase
in the 10-K. I just didn&#146;t understand when that was going to occur.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
I think, John, like I said in my prepared remarks, we&#146;re going to be down with
Foot Locker through the calendar year. But the early read on Spring, starting
to anniversary some of those numbers, is that we&#146;re starting to head back
north. So we feel like the business is starting to stabilize.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Shanley:<br>
Then the last part also on the U.S. front. Any concerns about-you saw the
numbers I&#146;m sure on Monday on Footstar. Any concern about Footstar in terms
of-I think it&#146;s still your second biggest customer, where that may be going and
what your relationship with the retail channels as they operate may be in going
forward?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
Yeah, John. First of all, Footstar is not our second biggest customer. With
respect to the business relationship with Footstar, at this point our sales
performance has been very good with Footstar and our accounts receivable are
current and we&#146;re not seeing any issues in terms of liquidity or other
financial issues at this point coming through Footstar.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Shanley:<br>
Super. Glad to hear it. Thanks a lot.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Brian McGough with Morgan Stanley:<br>
Just two quick questions. One is on U.S. apparel. It seems like it&#146;s just a
massive lever for next year. In your opinion, how confident are the retailers
that you can get them the product on time? Then just a follow-up on Converse
and the distribution there. There&#146;s some speculation out there that you guys
will take this downstream and have it be a mass market brand, which I can&#146;t
imagine is the case. So would you just hit on that and maybe what the
opportunity is to pull back international licenses?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
I think with respect to the USA apparel deliveries, I feel pretty good about
that. We&#146;ve corrected almost all of the issues that we dealt with in the back
half of last fiscal year, and our deliveries for fall have been a lot better. I
think if you check out the retail community, they&#146;ll start to reflect some of
that. So it is a potential lever for us next year, and we&#146;re kind of looking
forward to anniversarying some of those numbers.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">With respect to Converse, again I&#146;m just going to defer back to what we&#146;ve said
so far. We haven&#146;t really gotten a chance to sit down with the Converse team
and spend any time with them. That&#146;s something that&#146;s on the calendar here
relatively quickly. As soon as we get a little bit more defined position on
where we&#146;re at and how we go forward with the business, we will articulate it
publicly.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Virginia S. Genereux with Merrill Lynch &#038; Co.:<br>
One maybe for Don, I guess. Don, the way I&#146;m thinking about it is that we think
you have $.18 of currency help for the rest of the year. You beat this quarter
by $.18. I&#146;m looking at hedging and translation. Then maybe Converse is $.05.
That&#146;s $.41 right there, which is 15% EPS growth on your $2.77 of last year
plus anything else that might be happening in the business. You said you were
more confident about mid-teens EPS, but this quarter was up 21%. Why can&#146;t you
do a good bit better than that, may I ask?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
First of all, Virginia, you&#146;re stacking up some numbers I don&#146;t recognize
there. The translation impact this quarter was $.08, not $.18. Let&#146;s talk about
the growth rates. Yes, we&#146;re up 21% for the earnings per share in the first
quarter. As I said, though, we expect to have a somewhat more challenging
comparison in the second quarter because we&#146;re not only anniversarying a
pull-forward of revenue in Europe, but we also had a relatively light demand
creation spend last year because we were coming off the World Cup. The
combination of those two things means that our expectations around the second
quarter is that&#146;s going to be a more challenging comparison.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In the second half we definitely expect the third quarter to be the easier
comparison. We expect to do relatively well there. We had a very strong fourth
quarter last year. The currency benefits do start to narrow in the fourth
quarter because the euro was fairly high in the fourth quarter of last year.
The bottom line here is we do feel much more confident about our mid-teens
earnings growth target. Is it possible that if things all went right that we
could potentially do better than that? Yeah, it probably is. But at this stage,
what we&#146;re looking at is our long-term goals, and that&#146;s what we aim at.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Genereux:<br>
Okay, great. I was saying $.18 currencies for the rest of the year. May I ask
do you expect the second quarter math to be down year-over-year, Don, just for
everybody&#146;s benefit, on an EPS basis?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
At this point I think-all I&#146;d want to say is that&#146;s the most challenging
comparison. I&#146;m not sure it&#146;ll be down, but I think it&#146;s going to be the
toughest quarter of the year for us in terms of growth.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Genereux:<br>
Then lastly, on your last call I think you said you thought you could get some
SG&#038;A leverage this year. I have you not getting SG&#038;A leverage. What is your
thought on that, may I ask?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Blair:<br>
One of the things we&#146;ve talked about in the past, this is clearly the challenge
for us as we expand our business internationally. As our portfolio grows, we
certainly find it more difficult to leverage the overhead. Having said that, we
get a little bit of leverage in the first quarter. That&#146;s always our goal and
that&#146;s our target to try to do that for this year. But as I said, at this point
pulling all the levers in the business, we expect to improve our pretax profit
margin. I&#146;m not sure at this point I&#146;d expect to see a lot of leverage in SG&#038;A,
although that&#146;s always our goal.

Nice quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on the sell-through of
marquee products you&#146;re seeing this year and what differences you expect in the
presentation and promotion of that product when it goes back into Foot Locker.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Parker:<br>
Actually as I mentioned in my remarks, we&#146;re starting to see some really good
sell-through on marquee products. I mentioned the Shox NZ, the Ride, and the
Spiridon as three of the running shoes. We&#146;re also seeing that in Jordan. We&#146;ve
got some very strong product, I would say one of the strongest sets of marquee
products coming in the next two seasons between basketball, both Nike and
Jordan; training; continuing in running, even in football or soccer. We have
some of the strongest products above $100 that we&#146;ve had in a long time. We&#146;ll
continue to be bullish in terms of promoting, marketing that product; not just
through athletes but through TV and print campaigns and other events, what we
call &#147;360 marketing.&#148; We&#146;ll look at any opportunity to really create some
energy up at that level. But from a technology standpoint, a product
standpoint, a commercial potential standpoint, we think that the marquee
products that we have coming in the next three quarters are some of the
strongest we&#146;ve ever had, so quite bullish. As far as Foot Locker goes, I&#146;ll
let Charlie take that one.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
I&#146;m not sure I understood exactly what the question was regarding the Foot
Locker issue.

How do you expect the presentation and promotion of that to be different than
it might have been in the past in Foot Locker?
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Denson:<br>
I think, like I said, we don&#146;t traditionally talk about specific strategies
within specific accounts, so I don&#146;t think now is the time to start. I think
the overall comment that I will make in referring back to some of the things
that I&#146;ve talked about is our increasing profitability in the business, both
here in the U.S. at retail and at wholesale. The brand is in as good a shape
that it&#146;s ever been in and we continue to look at our distribution and how to
optimize it with respect to the business that we&#146;re trying to do. I can&#146;t say
how excited I am about the progress we&#146;ve made in the overall marketplace and
what the brand has been able to do with respect to shifting the emphasis back
into profitability as opposed to just driving pure revenue.
