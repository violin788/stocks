Welcome to NIKE's fiscal 2013 fourth quarter conference call. For those who need to reference today's press release you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations including equipment; NIKE Golf, Converse, and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.</font></div>

References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE&#8217;s website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.</font></div>

We&#8217;re set to grow, to explore, refine and leverage our leadership position.&#160;&#160;We have scale, power and passion, and we&#8217;re not shy about using them to support the athlete and that means every athlete to push ourselves and our partners to connect more deeply with consumers to grow this company and deliver more value to shareholders.</font></div>

What I know about Charlie is that he is a brilliant and affable man, easy to respect and easy to like, obsessed with sports and the athlete and he has incredible passion for the Brand. That&#8217;s a great combination. Even more important, Charlie showed the next generation what it takes &#8211; and what it means &#8211; to be a NIKE leader. And we go into the future stronger and more focused thanks in large part to the example Charlie set over the last three decades. Charlie is more than a colleague.

We are absolutely as confident in the business as we were 90 days ago. And in fact, when we look at our constant currency operating profits, they've actually gone up a little bit in terms of our expectations. But a couple of things have happened: number one is the FX environment's changed a bit, and that's been a little bit of a drag on the numbers; secondly, we finished FY'13 with a few more shares than we had expected 90 days ago; and finally, if you look at our tax lines, our FY'14 perspective has not changed but FY'13 came in a little better than what we had expected, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So from an operating standpoint, we're just as confident as we've been and very confident going into FY'14. There's just been a few things that have pulled our growth rate down a touch.</font></div>

We still feel like we have room for improvement in areas, but we've never had the ability to kind of surgically manage from an operational and financial standpoint as we do today. Very proud of that. And I think it's served us well, particularly over the last couple of years.</font></div>

The first question is the double-digit North American futures orders you guys put up today, another great number. Can you just give us some color on what channels might be driving that more than others as well as the average selling price component to that? And then if there's any changes in the categories driving that? And then the second question is just -- Brazil, some of the unrest that's gone there -- gone on there, if -- I was just curious if you guys had any color or thought on that.</font></div>

Running continues to still grow at double digits. Basketball is accelerating, and you saw the Q4 Basketball results, they were extremely strong. And certainly, the NBA playoff run didn't slow that down at all. And so we're very excited about that going into next year. We talked about women's. We're pretty excited about the women's piece. And then we're moving into our second year with the NFL here in North America. So it's really a broad-based portfolio of progress, I guess. And when you look at the way that the business is being made up, from a channel standpoint, we're doing it across all the channels. It's not one specific channel that's really stands out, good -- or better than the others and I think that, that speaks to the North America management team and the points of differentiation that we've been able to create in the marketplace.</font></div>

And the U.S., or North America, is a tremendous example of really operating a complete offense. And the exciting thing is as we see that kind of success from the U.S. and kind of turn on all cylinders there, we see the opportunity to really take a lot of that and apply that to other parts of the world. So leveraging that complete offense and those successes across the other geographies is really our plan. Very excited. And the other point is just -- and it relates to the organizational shift, Elliott Hill coming onboard to lead the geographies. He is incredibly experienced. He's done a fantastic job in North America, tremendous experience in both wholesale and retail, great energy, lots of passion and again, part of what I think is going to be a leadership team that has some tremendous chemistry. So Elliott and his team, to Charlie's point, deserve a lot of credit.</font></div>

And that trend line is pretty consistent. So we don't usually get into that level of granularity on a geography basis but all the geos are seeing similar trends.</font></div>

And we remain incredibly excited about the World Cup coming up and all the opportunities around that and then following that, the Olympics. This is, as we've said, our time to shine as a brand. And we have some pretty amazing things coming. Charlie alluded to that in the world of football. So we're excited about the opportunity in Brazil. But we'll stay close to it.</font></div>

It was great to hear your comments about the innovation in the supply chain and how it could possibly impact gross margins next year. And I know it's still early days with Flyknit and other efficiencies that you're finding in the supply chain, but I wondered if you could update us on how this is ramping up as a production discipline.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>

Well, first of all, we continue to be incredibly bullish on Flyknit for a number of reasons that we've talked about before, performance-wise, sustainability, margins, opportunities going forward as we scale that technology within Running, of course, but then across the other categories. So we are in the midst of a fairly major effort to scale Flyknit across other models. Over this next 12 months, you will see some very exciting new versions of Flyknit. And I would say just from a product standpoint, we're just scratching the surface in terms of the potential that it offers from a performance and an aesthetic standpoint, let alone the manufacturing capabilities that I think it brings us. That -- the manufacturing payoff, I think, will come, as we get this to even greater scale. And we're well on our way in terms of our plan to leverage, like I said, Flyknit across categories and even across price points as well. So you'll see some very exciting executions actually starting as early as August, this August, you'll see Flyknit actually meet NIKE Free. And that's a great combination. I'm tempted to say more but I can't.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Kate McShane &gt;:</font> Okay, great. And if I could just follow up on that question again with regards to the supply chain and some of the labor costs that you're seeing, obviously, labor has been a big pressure over the last couple of years, and I know you've guided for it. But is there anything different that you're seeing or has anything gotten more accelerated in certain geographies where you are manufacturing currently?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> Well, as far as acceleration, yes. We've definitely seen some fairly significant increases in wage rates in a couple of countries. I think the one in Indonesia certainly was pretty well publicized, and we haven't seen the growth in quite that level in other places but they've all been headed up. I think as Mark talked about a little bit with respect to Flyknit, I think the longer-term solution to addressing a lot of these labor cost issues is really engineering the labor out of the product, and that really is with technologies and innovations like Flyknit and there are number of others that we have in the pipeline that are aimed at the same thing. It will take some time. And that's why one of the reasons we spoke to this on the prepared remarks is that we are very carefully looking at all the other levers of gross margin, including price, as well as just how we manage our mix. One of the benefits we've seen in the last year or so is a real strength in the premium end of our business, which is the place where we have the most differentiation and the most opportunity for price. So long term, innovation we think is one of the ways to get at this labor cost pressure. On the near-term, we're also, obviously, looking at price and all the other levers in gross margin.</font></div>

I know there's a lot of great brands out there that have a kind of a pretty high penetration in terms of the mix of the business, revenues generated online. I know you guys have been more focused on the digital side, creating ecosystems, communities as well as the commercial side of the business. And how do you think about -- or how should we think about how and when the online platform can be ready to become a big contributor to the P&amp;L as part of the DTC overall?</font></div>

We see the opportunity there as continuing on. We're investing in mobile, for example, and seeing some great results there. Obviously, customization continues to be actually a very strong subset of our .com business, and we see lots of innovation opportunities there that are quite compelling. But overall, DTC and again, specifically, the e-commerce dimension of DTC is a huge and growing percentage of our overall business. I think we're just at the very front end. I mean, if you look at DTC as a percentage of some of the big verticals out there, it's quite significant. So we see ourselves, and along with our retail partners in terms of wholesale .com, is that there are some very significant opportunities for us and we're very, very focused and bullish.</font></div>

Certainly, there's a lot of things we can do to sharpen our e-commerce platforms but the connection points of all of that traffic that's going through our brand sites and all of the connections we have with consumers through things like NIKE+, we think have a multiplier effect in e-commerce that most pure-play e-commerce players can't match.</font></div>

My question is just a follow-up on China for a second. Don, you gave some pretty good color about how we think about revenues first half, second half. Any thoughts about how we think about the margin profile in China? You didn't do so bad here in this current quarter against some easy comparisons, but I guess just how do we think about that first half, second half and where maybe the inflection point could really start to happen?</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br>
</div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> Well, I don't want to get into that level of granularity again, but what I can do is talk to you a little bit about some of the dynamics there. I mean, certainly, one of the things that was mentioned on the last question was just the high margins we have in China. And one of the things that we believe is really exciting about the work we're doing right now with our retail partners is the opportunity still in the economics and productivity of the retail stores is that we can turn inventory faster. We think we can elevate the presentation for consumers, and we think that ultimately is better from a profitability standpoint for us and for the retailers. So yes, our margins have held up relatively well in the last quarter and I think there's a lot of things that we still think we can do going forward to manage that business for a high level of profitability. But I don't -- I don't want to get into the weeds of trying to guess where margins are going to be for any one quarter. Just one thing to keep underlining here is our goal is to get that market on to a sustainable profitable path. We're confident we can do it. We know how this works. It's just a question of working through the execution and being patient and disciplined, as everybody else mentioned today.</font></div>

And then just -- lastly, just on the gross margin outlook for you. I'd like to think that you guys are being somewhat conservative in terms of how you're thinking about it. You've done better than you've expected in the past 2 quarters or so. So I guess what maybe could be the opportunity whereby you guys could outperform your thought process in terms of gross margin? And maybe what's the biggest headwind? I mean, I think everyone might have anticipated you could have done a little bit better on the gross margin profile for this year just given the pricing increases. So just maybe a little more color about where maybe the opportunities could be.</font></div>

<div style="TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> Well, one thing to bear in mind and I've mentioned this in the prepared remarks, there's a lot of currency headwind in these numbers for, particularly, the first quarter. So we do hedge, which means that for major currencies, we are largely protected for a period of time but we don't hedge 100% and there's a lot of currencies that we don't hedge, particularly developing market currencies. So a more favorable FX environment would certainly help. From a business standpoint, there is clearly a positive impact to managing inventories and keeping the market within that pull mode. And one of the things that, obviously, we've been doing, as you saw our inventory numbers today, is keeping that inventory in check. And so the upside in this business model, as you know, are keep the inventories tight, make sure the brand is hot, sell-through maximum at full price, and that's where the upside comes from. So we have a lot of moving parts in here, I think as Mark said, we're better and better at this as each quarter goes by. And I hope you're right. I hope there's opportunity in the gross margin number.</font></div>

There was a bit of a divergence in your footwear versus apparel sales. And I was curious if you could add a little bit more color to that and talk about whether your futures number also reflected a similar trend.</font></div>

Hold on. Actually, they're fairly close. Futures actually accelerated a little bit in apparel more than footwear, but they're pretty even. Obviously, with the number at 12, we've still got great momentum in the marketplace in footwear. And as we talked about over the last couple of calls, we're really focused on improving our apparel position. We think it's one of our biggest opportunities, and I think we're starting to see some that momentum and work pay off a little bit, especially in North American geography.</font></div>

It's definitely holding true as we move into -- or will as we move into FY14. So if you look at footwear and apparel and you look across the categories, and frankly, up and down the price points, I think we look actually quite strong in North America from a complete picture standpoint. So we continue to be bullish on the opportunities in North America as we move into FY14.</font></div>

And then just when you talk about doubling down on innovation, are you talking about doubling down on your investment, that we should expect much greater frequency of products with innovation associated with them or much deeper innovation associated with them? And may be just help frame what the practical implications of that statement are.</font></div>

And with that comes, it's not just more, it's better. So we need to edit against that incredible list of opportunities and make sure that we're investing in the things that we think we can leverage for the greatest success to fuel growth, improve performance, sustainability, et cetera. And really, we have a very disciplined process by which we edit against all those opportunities. So yes, we have some funding that we put aside to look at getting behind some of these more compelling innovation opportunities. I won't speak to specifically what those are but the intent is to really rally behind those opportunities that are going to give us the greatest potential to grow the business and frankly, to leverage across categories, price points and even the brands within the portfolio. So I am incredibly excited, but at the same time, I know the discipline that needs to go with managing innovation to achieve the greatest impact.</font></div>

And our guidance for FY14 does contemplate that as well. So as Mark said, we've been investing in places like digital and product innovation and manufacturing innovation and so on, and we would continue to do that. But that is embedded in our guidance that we gave you for FY14.</font></div>

And then just one last one. You talked about the higher share count being a headwind to some degree of your EPS growth for next year and I can think of a pretty easy solution to that considering all the cash you guys are sitting on. So maybe just can you talk about what you plan to do with your extra billion in - - your balance sheet?</font></div>

And certainly, buying our own stock is going to be a component of that as well. And we do expect to be strong buyers of our own stock. We try to do that as efficiently as we can, and obviously, your ability to see into the future is always a little murky. But we are very enthusiastic about returning cash to shareholders as well as investing in the business. And that offering, we felt was well timed to give us the flexibility going forward to continue to do both.</font></div>
