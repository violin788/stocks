percent to $350.8 million, compared to $325.8 million in the prior year and
diluted earnings per share increased 10 percent to $1.37, versus $1.24 last
year.

"We had a strong third quarter. Our mix of compelling product and premium
consumer experiences drove a meaningful acceleration of futures orders," said
Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. president and chief executive officer.  "We continue to
grow because we're innovative, disciplined, and connected to our consumers."*

Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2007 through July 2007, totaling
$6.0 billion, 9 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period
last year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased reported orders growth
by 1 percentage point.*

By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 8 percent; Europe (which
includes the Middle East and Africa) increased 9 percent; Asia Pacific grew 14
percent; and the Americas increased 2 percent. Changes in currency exchange
rates increased the reported futures orders growth in Europe and Asia Pacific
by 2 percentage points; and in the Americas region decreased reported futures
growth by 1 percentage point.*

Income Statement Review

Selling and administrative expenses were 31.7 percent of third quarter
revenues, compared to 30.1 percent last year. Results for the third quarter

option expense third quarter net income increased 13 percent and diluted
earnings per share increased 16 percent to $1.44.

The effective tax rate for the third quarter declined to 32.3 percent mainly
due to a new European tax agreement, which was finalized in the second quarter
of fiscal 2007 and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and
development tax credit signed into law in December.

Balance Sheet Review

At quarter end, global inventories stood at $2.2 billion, an increase of 7

based on pre-tax income.  Total pre-tax income equals Income before
income taxes as shown on the Consolidated Income Statement.

income, which includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the
operating segments for management reporting and intercompany
eliminations for specific items in the Consolidated Income Statement.

* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal
year 2007 presentation.  These changes had no impact on previously
reported results of operations or shareholders' equity.
