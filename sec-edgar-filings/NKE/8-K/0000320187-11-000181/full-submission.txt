Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of Futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.</font></div>

Wholesale equivalent sales include both reported revenue and estimations of sales by licensees based on the royalties paid. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc., and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.</font></div>

We are closing the calendar year with a very strong second-quarter performance. And looking at our results you can see that NIKE, Inc. portfolio is a powerful engine for growth.</font></div>

</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">NIKE, Inc. revenue for the quarter reached $5.7 billion, up 18%. Earnings per share grew 6% to $1. And global NIKE Brand Futures grew 13%. Overall a remarkable performance in what continues to be a very volatile global economy that has yet to deliver a uniform recovery.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And looking ahead, economic and political uncertainty are unlikely to abate in any meaningful way in the short term, so risks and challenges do remain. But that said, we are well-positioned and resourced to manage risk and continue to drive growth going forward.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">There are two things I want to touch on today that connect our results from Q2 with where we are headed in the back half of the year and beyond. The first is confidence. We create and commercialize innovation with a speed and quality unmatched by anyone in the industry. We do that because we are deeply connected to athletes. They inspire us, they challenge us, and they help us create the products and experiences that come to life in stores, online and in the most important markets all around the world.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Athletes will always be our most important partners, and our brands will always be our strongest asset. People seek out brands they can trust and products that are relevant, especially in a more challenging economy. We have seven distinct and high-energy brands delivering on that promise across categories, geographies, price points and channels.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Our brands are a source of authentic emotional connections, and they offer the power and flexibility needed to create and convert growth to value for our shareholders. So truly innovative products, experiences and brands run by the strongest management team in the industry, that is a big part of why I see more opportunity now than ever before.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The second thing I want to touch on is focus. Recently we held a meeting of our top 250 NIKE leaders from around the world. We came together to see and talk about what the future holds for the Company. And that meeting focused on how we are really drilling down to identify and resource the most compelling growth opportunities for NIKE, Inc., what we call Edit to Amplify.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">By being better editors we are able to be laser focused on what we are doing, who we are partnering with, and where we are investing to reach our full potential as a Company and as a leader in this industry.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">I won't provide all the details, but I will tell you that we have opened the door to truly game-changing innovation. And some of the most powerful potential for innovation lies in the digital technology space. We are using digital to change everything about the product creation process from the time it leaves the mind of the designer to when it gets into the hands of our consumer. Truly breakthrough innovation that will allow us to accelerate how we create and commercialize new products.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Social networking and digital communication is helping us unify and expand the family of sport. We have never been closer to our consumers as they continue to extend their reach and connect even more with each other, with their sports heroes and their favorite teams. And digital technology is a powerful enabler of the huge opportunities we have in our Direct-to-Consumer business and in working with our wholesale partners.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It was an amazing leadership meeting that not only showcased the game-changing innovation to come, but dramatically exhibited the continued benefits of key decisions and very focused investments we have made over the last five years -- like going to the category offense and elevating Apparel, investing in DTC and our wholesale partners, and making the big commitment it takes to revolutionize our product, our manufacturing and our supply chain, creating even greater growth potential.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Confidence and focus are incredibly powerful and you're going to see them come to life on the field, the courts and tracks where global sporting events unfold over the next 12 months. The BCS Games, the NBA Finals, the Euro Champs, the Summer Olympics in London, the NFL, these are the moments that inspire us, that motivate us and allow us to share the world stage with the greatest athletes alive. They will be at their best, and I can assure you so will we.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Going forward we will continue to use the unique power of our portfolio to drive growth and manage risk, to be opportunistic and disciplined, to connect with people locally and globally. In short, to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.</font></div>

We are confident, we are focused, and we are hungry. And, of course, you can expect us to act accordingly. So thanks everyone and now here is Charlie.</font></div>

Happy Holidays everybody. It was a very good Q2 for the NIKE Brand. I think it illustrates the three crucial elements of our growth strategy. You have heard me talk about them a lot. That is innovative product, brand strength, and premium distribution. And all three come to life through our category offense. That is how we continue to transform the marketplace and that is how we deliver the kind of numbers we are seeing today.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Let's take a look at our NIKE Brand results on a constant currency basis. Global revenue was up 18%, and global Futures are up 13%. Every geography except Japan grew its topline. And six of our seven key categories increased revenue. Our Brand DTC revenue increased nearly 20%, propelled by positive comp store growth in both factory and in-line locations, as well as higher online sales.</font></div>

We have been pretty busy here. We released the LeBron 9, the first Basketball shoe to combine Flywire and Hyperfuse technologies.</font></div>

And the day after tomorrow we're releasing the Kobe 7 System Supreme. It allows players to switch out inserts to match their styles of play.</font></div>

It also increased our Basketball revenue double-digits for the quarter. We are all happy to see the NBA start up again with five great games on Christmas Day. But that is the just the beginning. Along with that we are looking forward to March Madness, the NBA Finals, and then on to the Olympics in London. We are at the front of another great run of momentum in Basketball around the world. That is great for fans. It is great for the game, and of course, it is great for NIKE.</font></div>

It has been a great quarter. In fact, it has been a great year. My favorite running story of the quarter has to be the event we did in Seoul, South Korea, a city with incredible energy and a growing influence in youth culture.</font></div>

Last quarter I outlined three key themes that drove our financial results and our outlook -- strong topline momentum, fueled by our category offense and the quality of our innovation agenda; the power of our portfolio that allows us to manage risk and outperform in a volatile macro environment; and our focus on delivering both near-term performance and long-term shareholder value.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Those themes were again reflected in our second-quarter results. As Charlie and Mark spoke to earlier, the category offense and our innovation capabilities enable us to deliver highly differentiated product, deep brand connections, and compelling retail experiences to consumers around the world.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Those capabilities are driving incredible topline momentum, and will also enable us to continue to deliver a strong price/value equation to consumers even as higher prices hit the market.</font></div>

</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The second theme is the power of our portfolio to drive growth and manage risk. In Q2 revenue growth accelerated in our largest businesses, the NIKE Brand and Converse. And that was across multiple categories and in both developed and developing markets.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The breadth and diversification of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio, combined with our strong balance sheet, uniquely positions us to effectively manage through the ongoing economic uncertainty that has become the new normal. While no company can completely eliminate risk, our ability to leverage our portfolio of brands, geographies, categories and operational capabilities gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver on our goals.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">The third theme is our ongoing commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value and near-term results. As our Q2 results show, we continue to see significant pressure on gross margins from input cost increases. We are also facing increasingly significant FX headwinds. We will manage the levers of our profit equation to mitigate risk and deliver near-term profitability. That said, we will also invest in our business to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders.</font></div>

Reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 18%, up 16% on a currency-neutral basis. The revenue increase was driven by robust growth for the NIKE Brand and Converse.</font></div>

Futures increased at a double digit rate for all categories except Sportswear and Action Sports, which grew at a mid-single-digit rate. Unit orders increased 7%, while average price per unit added 6 points of growth, due mostly to price increases that take effect for the Spring and Summer seasons.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Gross margin for Q2 was down 260 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher product costs. This downside was partially offset by strong growth in our Direct-to-Consumer business, moderate price increases for our Fall and Holiday seasons, and the benefits of our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As we have discussed on prior calls, there is a six to nine month time lag between changes in input costs and higher cost of goods sold reported on our P&amp;L. As a result, the Holiday 2011 and Spring 2012 seasons reflect the peak materials costs we saw earlier this calendar year. As we move into the Summer and Fall 2012 seasons, we expect our cost of goods sold to reflect the lower materials costs we have seen more recently.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We continue to expect the rate of gross margin decline to narrow over the balance of this fiscal year. But given our Q2 results and current exchange rates we now believe we will see a least 160 basis points of gross margin erosion for the full fiscal year.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">As we anticipated, inventory levels plateaued in Q2 while the rate of inventory growth improved sequentially from last quarter. The dollar value of NIKE, Inc. inventories increased 35% versus last year, driven by 39% growth for the NIKE Brand. About 20 percentage points of the increase for NIKE Brand inventories was driven by higher unit inventories, a significant deceleration versus the 34% growth we reported in Q1.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now, as then, the unit increase versus last year's relatively low levels was driven by strong demand and ongoing improvement in factory deliveries. The remaining 19 percentage points of inventory growth for NIKE, Inc. and NIKE Brand -- excuse me -- were the result of higher costs per unit primarily due to input costs inflation.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Overall we are comfortable with current inventory levels and trends. That said, we will continue to manage our inventories carefully to support market demand and manage risk. We continue to expect inventory balances to remain stable over the remaining quarters of the fiscal year, with the rate of inventory growth declining sequentially and coming more into line with revenue growth by Q4.</font></div>

And in Q2 we generated $360 million of free cash flow from operations. As our inventory balances stabilize, we expect to generate more normal levels of free cash flow from operations in the second half of the fiscal year.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we expect that the brand connection with the consumer in China is going to continue to get stronger and stronger for Converse. And that we have seen upgrades happening on a steady, consistent basis in our retail presentation, so the outlook for Converse in China is actually quite bullish.

We had a great quarter in Apparel. There is certainly a great appetite for Nike Apparel in the China marketplace, but as you know, China represents a much more balanced weighting between Footwear and Apparel. We are taking advantage of the opportunity; there is still more work to be done.</font></div>

But anticipating your question, we did not see a significant slowdown in unit sales growth over the course of the window. So this is relatively higher percentage growth in revenue projections for the back half of the window because of the price increases, but we didn't see a significant change in the unit velocity over the window.</font></div>

That was 39% up on the NIKE Brand side. So that is the overwhelming majority of both the inventory and it obviously drove the growth. So that 39% growth on the NIKE Brand side, 20 points of the growth was increase in units. And that compared to 34% increase in units in Q1. So we are definitely seeing the rate of growth of units come down. And we are actually -- in absolute quantities it is plateauing, as we expected it would.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So that is the majority of the growth, about 20 points. The remaining 19 points of growth is largely due to increased cost per unit. And as you know, that is pretty much the input cost increases we have seen -- labor and materials.</font></div>

When we look at the key materials, what we are seeing today is the prices as they were in the Spring of 2011, and that was really the peak. So we are really not going to start to see this come down until we get in more towards the very tail end of Summer and Fall of 2012.</font></div>

Is that true of the balance of the year and where you are seeing greater pressure than you expected?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> You are correct that that is a key driver for the quarter, that we expected discounts to get a little better, they didn't. And for the balance of the year we do expect a continuation of that. But in addition, as I said earlier, we also are seeing more FX pressure in the back half than we expected 90 days ago. And also much greater strengths in North America and somewhat weaker results in Western Europe primarily. So is really those three factors that are driving the balance of the year change in outlook.</font></div>

Or I guess, what is driving the change in the improvement in discounts, is it specific to a region, is it specific to the inventory levels that you have today, what is the root cause?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;The guidance for both the third and the fourth quarter is the same, which is slightly above the Futures growth that we reported today.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>
</div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;Q &#8211; Michael Binetti &gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;Okay, thanks for that. And then the -- I just want to make sure we are setting the bar appropriately for folks listening here. As far as the price increases that are coming up are the -- are those completely reflected in the Futures orders at this point? Or in other words, is there another incremental bump-up to come next quarter, just so we have expectations correctly for how that will affect Futures windows going forward?</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Don Blair&gt;:</font> So the Futures numbers we just reported today, as we said, there was about a 7 percentage point increase in units and about a 6 percentage point increase in value per unit. This Futures window includes December and January, which will have some Holiday therefore in the window. So when you get to the next Futures window it is going to be Spring and Summer, and therefore, you'll be reflective of the full impact of the price increases for Spring and Summer.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So I would expect to see -- just the mix of months involved here, we have got some of Holiday and some of Spring here, whereas the next one is going to be Spring and Summer, so it should be a little higher.</font></div>

And then just, I guess, on the comment, I know you're getting beat to death on gross margins here, so I apologize. But on the comment about discounting being a little more sticky than you thought previously -- and I know you gave little detail there, but we have got higher discounts that I guess are surprising you guys a little bit heading into price increases.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">And I'm just kind of -- I would like to be able to get a little bit more of what makes you confident heading into price increases that the discounting won't surprise you on the upside a little bit going forward. Is there anything you can tell us that gives you more confidence that the price increases won't need to be discounted at a heavier level, just considering that was one of the comments today? Thanks.</font></div>

The question around the pricing really has to do with the consumer response. And as we have said before, we think we are in the best possible position to be taking price increases at this particular point, given the strength of the brand and the innovation pipeline.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">So we think we are in terrific shape.

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">With respect to what drives the level of discounts on a shorter-term basis that is really more of the supply chain around things like delivery timing and overall inventory levels. And as we said earlier on the call, we are seeing great improvement in on-time performance coming out of our factories. Our air freight is down. So as we start to see our supply-chain smooth out, I think we're going to also see that those discount levels can be managed down.</font></div>

But on the other hand, I hear you guys talk, and we see it in the marketplace, the innovation that is in place, the impact of your category offense, you know, the Running, the Basketball innovations and product line you have been talking about early on the call.</font></div>

And that is that, first of all, we are managing a long-term growth trajectory here.

And we were really short of capacity on some of our most important technologies. And we feel like we have negated that going forward and that we are in a position now to really maximize and optimize some of the technologies that are in the marketplace.</font></div>

And I think that is one of the things that gives us such great confidence about the future is some of the new innovation that we have in the pipeline that you will start to see maybe as soon as the Olympics.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;A &#8211; Mark Parker&gt;:</font>&#160;&#160;I will chime in. This is Mark. I speak a lot about innovation and much of that is around product, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a lot of information focus around our supply chain, specifically in working with our factories to upgrade, I think, their ability to innovate with us.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&#160;And that is beyond what we have talked about in the past in terms of lean manufacturing -- and then looking at whole new ways to manufacture products. These are things that will really take shape and have much more profound impact, I think, between the topline and the bottom-line in the months and years to come.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&#160;Some of the dramatic breakthroughs that I referenced in my remarks earlier are happening on the manufacturing side as well. And you will see NIKE take a much more active position in trying to drive innovation from design, all the way through the manufacturing process. I think that is absolutely critical for us to be a competitive company moving into the future, and really, again, apply innovation as best we can within that part of our business.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&#160;So I can't be very specific at this point, but I can tell you that we are incredibly excited about, as I said, some of the real game-changing innovation that is coming.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt"><br>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&#160;I spoke earlier about innovation as it relates to the events that are coming up. You're going to see some very dramatic innovation from NIKE in the months ahead, and as Charlie mentioned, a few surprises. Much of this is going to be coming around the Summer Olympics or leading up to the Summer Olympics, where I think NIKE does its best work. We really rally behind these big global sporting events.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&#160;So some of the innovation you're going to be seeing actually quite shortly, and then really leading up through the next six months is going to be, I think, some of the most dramatic innovation that you have ever seen from NIKE. So very, very excited about all of that.</font></div>

You are also seeing it from the US. I am curious what the dynamic is with Performance in other areas of the world? What stage of adoption are you with Performance Apparel offerings in some of the other regions?</font></div>

Well, no, it is not just the US or Europe, it is really a worldwide -- I wouldn't call it a phenomena -- I think we are just servicing the needs of the athlete, and I think it is paying off for us, not only with regards to the revenue line, but I think also the brand strength line.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">It is an area where we felt we had one of the bigger opportunities to, not only improve, but to really push the envelope. We have made some pretty significant investments into the advanced R&amp;D areas around our Apparel business. And we are very excited about the future of the Apparel business being led by some of the performance innovation that we have talked about.</font></div>

And it gives us a great combination of both Performance and Sportswear together, which is what we talk about all the time. We talk about this Amplify Sport approach.</font></div>

And then a question with respect to China, have you been pleased thus far with the performance of the new China DC? There has been some timing of shipment dynamics. Have there been any hiccups there? And are you starting to see some of the cost benefits that you expected to see from opening that?</font></div>

It is the greenest building, I think, in China right now. It is one of the most impressive distribution facilities to date that have been built there.</font></div>

<div style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">We have had great cooperation from, whether it is the Chinese government or our teams on the ground. There have been some short-term costs, as you'd expect, getting the thing up and running. But it gives us huge competitive advantages as we continue to expand in the marketplace, from managing our timing of deliveries, launching of products, coordination of Footwear and Apparel. It is a great competitive advantage for us. So we are excited about it and the role that it will play in the future.</font></div>

It really had nothing to do with either deliveries this year or deliveries out of our distribution center in China. So no issue on the financials showing up from issues at the China Logistics Center. It is doing great.</font></div>
