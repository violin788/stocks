Beaverton, OR (June 24, 2004) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported
revenues and earnings for the Company's fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended May 31, 2004. Fourth quarter revenues increased 17 percent to $3.5
billion, versus $3.0 billion for the same period last year. Seven
percentage points of this growth were the result of changes in currency
exchange rates.  Fourth quarter net income totaled $305.0 million, or
$1.13 per diluted share, compared to $246.2 million, or $0.92 per diluted
share in the prior year.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, revenues increased 15 percent to
$12.3 billion, compared to $10.7 billion in fiscal year 2003. Changes in
currency exchange rates contributed seven percentage points of this
growth.  Full year net income totaled $945.6 million, or $3.51 per
diluted share, versus $740.1 million before accounting change, or $2.77
per diluted share, in 2003.  After a one-time charge from the cumulative
effect of implementing Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 142
(Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets), the Company posted net income of
$474.0 million, or $1.77 per diluted share in 2003.

Philip H. Knight, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "It was a
great year for the Nike brand around the world, complemented by
outstanding results across our brand portfolio and the acquisition of
Converse.  We managed the business well, recording our highest gross
margins ever and generating tremendous cash flow.  But, most
importantly," Knight added, "we focused on doing what we do best:
creating energy and excitement through innovative new products and strong
connections with consumers.  As a result, Nike, Inc. posted its strongest
revenue and earnings per share growth in five years, delivering 15 and
27* percent increases, respectively."

Knight continued, "It was also a great year for Nike shareholders.
Nike's stock price increased 27% for fiscal year 2004.  During the year
we raised our quarterly dividend over 40%, and in the fourth
quarter, we completed our four-year $1 billion share repurchase program.
Over the past four years, Nike has returned $1.6 billion to shareholders
through share repurchases and dividends.  And I'm pleased to announce
that our Board has authorized a new four-year, $1.5 billion share
repurchase program, reflecting confidence in our ability to continue to
deliver strong cash flows in the future."**


Futures Orders

The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and
apparel, scheduled for delivery between June and November 2004, totaling
$5.5 billion, 10.7 percent higher than such orders reported for the same
period last year.  One point of this growth was due to changes in
currency exchange rates.**

By region, U.S. futures were up 10 percent; Europe increased nine
percent; Asia Pacific grew 21 percent; and the Americas increased four
percent.  Changes in currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of
three percentage points in Europe and two percentage points in Asia
Pacific.  The Americas orders included a six percentage point decline due
to changes in currency exchange rates.**

Knight said, "Nike's brand momentum was clearly evident in our futures
results, which reached their highest level in seven years.  All of our
regions posted healthy futures increases in both footwear and apparel,
but we're particularly encouraged by results in the U.S.  The region
reported its strongest footwear futures growth in eight years."**
