Revocation by one or more signers of this Guaranty or any other guarantors of the Obligations shall not (a)&nbsp;affect the obligations under this Guaranty of any non-revoking Guarantors, (b)&nbsp;apply to Obligations outstanding when Agent receives
written notice of revocation, or to any extensions, renewals, readvances, modifications, amendments or replacements of such Obligations, or (c)&nbsp;apply to Obligations, arising after Agent receives such notice of revocation, which are created
pursuant to a commitment existing at the time of the revocation, whether or not there exists an unsatisfied condition to such commitment or Agent has another defense to its performance. All of Agent&#146;s rights pursuant to this Guaranty continue
with respect to amounts previously paid to Agent on account of any Obligations which are thereafter restored or returned by Agent, whether in an insolvency proceeding of Borrower or for any other reason, all as though such amounts had not been paid
to Agent; and Guarantor&#146;s liability under this Guaranty (and all its terms and provisions) shall be reinstated and revived, notwithstanding any surrender or cancellation of this Guaranty. Agent, at its sole discretion, may determine whether any
amount paid to it must be restored or returned; provided, however, that if Agent elects to contest any claim for return or restoration, Guarantor agrees to indemnify and hold Agent harmless from and against all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, expended or incurred by Agent in connection with such contest. If an Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement, at Agent&#146;s election, Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this Guaranty shall
