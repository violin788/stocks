sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange shall be determined by Agent (a)&nbsp;with respect to any amount denominated in Dollars, the equivalent amount thereof in the applicable
Alternative Currency or the applicable other currency, in each case as determined by Agent by reference to Bloomberg (or such other publicly available service for displaying exchange rates), to be the exchange rate for the purchase of such
Alternative Currency or such other currency, as applicable with Dollars at approximately 11:00 a.m. on the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days immediately preceding the date on which final judgment is given; provided, however, that if no such rate is
available, the Alternative Currency Equivalent or other currency equivalent, as applicable, shall be determined by Agent using any reasonable method of determination after giving due consideration to then-prevailing market convention for determining
the exchange rate for the purchase of such Alternative Currency or such other currency, as applicable with Dollars; (b)&nbsp;if such amount is expressed in an Alternative Currency, the equivalent of such amount in Dollars or the applicable other
currency, in each case as determined by using the rate of exchange for the purchase of Dollars or such other currency, as applicable with the Alternative Currency last provided (either by publication or otherwise provided to Agent) by the applicable
Bloomberg source (or such other publicly available source for displaying exchange rates) on date that is two (2)&nbsp;Business Days immediately preceding the date on which final judgment is given (or if such service ceases to be available or ceases
to provide such rate of exchange, the equivalent of such amount in Dollars or such other currency, as applicable as determined by Agent using any reasonable method of determination after giving due consideration to then-prevailing market convention

determined by Agent using any reasonable method of determination after giving due consideration to then-prevailing market convention for the determination of such exchange rate on the date that is two (2)&nbsp;Business Days immediately preceding the

extent that on the Business Day following receipt by Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures
purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to Agent or any Lender from any Loan Party in the Agreement Currency, such Loan Party agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to Agent or any Lender
in such currency, Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Loan Party (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under Applicable law). Any determination by Agent pursuant to clause (a),
(b) or (c)&nbsp;above shall be conclusive absent manifest error. </P>
