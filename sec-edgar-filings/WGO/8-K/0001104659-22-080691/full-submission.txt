2022, Winnebago Industries, Inc., Winnebago of Indiana, LLC, Grand Design RV, LLC and Newmar Corporation (collectively, the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;)
entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) among the Borrowers, the other loan parties
party thereto from time to time, the lenders party thereto from time to time and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent

Agreement amends and restates in its entirety that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 22, 2019, as amended
on November 15, 2019 and July 8, 2020, among the Borrowers, the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto from time
to time and the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Existing Credit Agreement&#8221;), which provided for a five-year asset-based lending
credit facility of up to $192.5 million.</span></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><span style="background-color: white">Among other
things, the new Credit Agreement increases the maximum commitments available under the credit facility by $157.5 million to $350 million
and extends the maturity date to July 15, 2027, subject to certain factors which may accelerate the maturity date.</span></p>

<p style="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><span style="background-color: white">The Borrowers&#8217;
obligations to repay amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers
and certain of their subsidiaries, and the amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is limited to the lesser of the facility
total and the calculated borrowing base, which is based on certain loan percentages applied to eligible accounts receivable and eligible
inventories of the Borrowers. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, subject to availability, may be made at the election of the Borrowers
based on various rates plus applicable spreads depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement
bear interest at a floating rate consisting of an applicable spread of between 1.25%-1.75% (the &#8220;Applicable Spread&#8221;) based
upon the average daily amount of the facility available but unused during the most recent quarter plus, at the Borrower&#8217;s election,
either term SOFR or REVSOFR30 (plus, in each case, a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%), as well as a commitment fee of between 0.25%-0.75%
based upon the average daily amount of the facility available but unused during the most recent quarter. The Borrowers currently have
no borrowings outstanding and, so long as at least 66% of the aggregate commitment under the facility remains available but unused during
the most recent fiscal quarter, would pay an Applicable Spread of 1.25% plus the floating rates set forth above on any future borrowings
under the Credit Agreement and currently pay a commitment fee of 0.25% on the average daily amount of the facility available, but unused.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, limitations and events of default,
consistent with the Existing Credit Agreement.</span></p>

of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare,
amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. In addition, as a condition to any such Letter of Credit issuance, the applicable Borrower
shall have entered into a continuing agreement (or other letter of credit agreement) for the issuance of letters of credit and/or shall
submit a letter of credit application in each case, as required by the Issuing Bank and using such Issuing Bank&rsquo;s standard form

(i)&nbsp;the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed $35,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers shall be in compliance with the Revolving Exposure
Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue or
modify any Letter of Credit if, immediately after giving effect thereto, the outstanding LC Exposure in respect of all Letters of Credit
issued by such Person and its Affiliates would exceed such Issuing Bank&rsquo;s Issuing Bank Sublimit. Without limiting the foregoing
and without affecting the limitations contained herein, it is understood and agreed that the Borrower Representative may from time to
time request that an Issuing Bank issue Letters of Credit in excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit in effect at the time of such
request, and each Issuing Bank agrees to consider any such request in good faith. Any Letter of Credit so issued by an Issuing Bank in
excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit then in effect shall nonetheless constitute a Letter of Credit for all purposes of the
Credit Agreement, and shall not affect the Issuing Bank Sublimit of any other Issuing Bank, subject to the limitations on the aggregate
