(&#147;<B>Viracta</B>&#148;), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated November&nbsp;29, 2020, by and among the Company, Sol Merger Sub, Inc. (&#147;<B>Merger Sub</B>&#148;) and Viracta (the
&#147;<B>Merger Agreement</B>&#148;), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Viracta, with Viracta surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also, on February&nbsp;24, 2021, in connection with and immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;<B>Effective Time</B>&#148;), the
Company effected a reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&#147;<B>Common Stock</B>&#148;), at a ratio of&nbsp;3.5:1&nbsp;(the &#147;<B>Reverse Stock Split</B>&#148;), and changed its name from
&#147;Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#148; to &#147;Viracta Therapeutics, Inc.&#148; (the &#147;<B>Name Change</B>&#148;). Following the completion of the Merger, the business conducted by the Company became primarily the business conducted by
Viracta, a clinical-stage, biomarker-directed precision oncology company focused on advancing new medicines for the treatment of virus-associated malignancies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company issued shares of its Common Stock to Viracta&#146;s stockholders, at an exchange ratio of 0.3917 shares
of Common Stock (prior to taking into account the Reverse Stock Split), in exchange for each share of Viracta&#146;s common stock outstanding as of the Effective Time (including the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of
preferred stock prior to the Effective Time). The Company also assumed all of the stock options issued and outstanding under the Viracta 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, (the &#147;<B>Viracta Plan</B>&#148;) and issued and outstanding
warrants of Viracta, with such stock options and warrants henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 0.3917 multiplied by the number of shares of Viracta&#146;s common stock previously represented by
such stock options and warrants, as applicable, prior to taking into account the Reverse Stock Split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immediately following the Effective Time, there
were approximately 37.0 million&nbsp;shares of Common Stock outstanding (post Reverse Stock Split). Immediately following the Effective Time, the former Viracta stockholders owned approximately 86.05% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and
the Company&#146;s stockholders immediately prior to the Merger, whose shares of Common Stock remain outstanding after the Merger, owned approximately 13.95% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The issuance of the shares of Common Stock to the former stockholders of Viracta was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the

its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change. As of the opening of trading on Nasdaq on February&nbsp;25, 2021, the Common Stock will begin to trade on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted

immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split was reduced into a smaller number of shares, such that every 3.5 shares of Common Stock held by a stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were combined and reclassified into one share of

accomplishments of our team to get us to this moment. We believe we are strongly positioned to execute on our operating plans as a well-capitalized publicly traded company with a focused corporate strategy,&#148; said Ivor Royston, M.D., President
and Chief Executive Officer of Viracta. &#147;This year we are poised to advance our novel <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-oral</FONT> combination therapy into a global registrational trial in
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EBV-positive</FONT> lymphoma, and further expand into <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EBV-positive</FONT> solid tumors, and we look forward to driving value to patients and shareholders in the years ahead. We
greatly appreciate the support of our new and existing shareholders as we work to achieve these goals, which represent critical steps on the path towards addressing the unmet needs of patients suffering from these virus-associated
malignancies.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Viracta&#146;s lead program evaluates the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">all-oral</FONT> combination of nanatinostat, its
proprietary investigational drug, and valganciclovir in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EBV-positive</FONT> relapsed/refractory (R/R) lymphoma. There are currently no approved therapies for <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EBV-associated</FONT> cancers, which are responsible for over 140,000 deaths each year. Viracta&#146;s precision oncology combination therapy targets <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EBV-positive</FONT> cancer cells with
an inducible synthetic lethality approach. Viracta plans to initiate a registration trial for the treatment of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EBV-positive</FONT> lymphoma in the first half of 2021, and a Phase 1b/2 trial in <FONT
