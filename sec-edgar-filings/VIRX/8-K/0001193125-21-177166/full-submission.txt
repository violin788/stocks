held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount

on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause&nbsp;(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause&nbsp;(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by the Agent.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Agent, on the other hand, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses

provided, however, that upon termination of such prohibition, such interest shall immediately become Collateral without any action by Borrower or Bank; (d)&nbsp;more than sixty-five percent (65%) of the presently existing and hereafter arising
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock owned by Borrower of any Foreign Subsidiary which shares entitle the holder thereof to vote for directors or any other matter, but only to the extent that pledging greater than sixty-five percent (65%)
