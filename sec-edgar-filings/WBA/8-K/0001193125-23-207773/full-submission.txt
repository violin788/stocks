The Delayed Draw Credit Agreement&#8217;s termination date is the date that is three years after the initial funding of the loans (if any) under the agreement. Loans under the Delayed Draw Credit Agreement shall be denominated in U.S. dollars. The Revolving Credit Agreement&#8217;s termination date is the date that is three years after the Signing Date.

The applicable margin is in each case based on the rating of the Company&#8217;s corporate debt obligations as determined by Moody&#8217;s or S&amp;P. With respect to one week interest payment periods, loans will bear interest at the daily SOFR rate <span style="font-style:italic">plus</span> 0.03839% and the applicable margin.

a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such
other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#147;<B>Judgment </B><B>Currency</B>&#148;) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the &#147;<B>Agreement Currency</B>&#148;),
be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of
the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the
Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). </P>

Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of WBA that is not guaranteed by any other person or subject to any other credit enhancement. If (i)&nbsp;either Moody&#146;s or S&amp;P shall not have in effect an Index Debt Rating (other than by reason of the
circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Rating Category 5; (ii) the Index Debt Ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody&#146;s
and S&amp;P shall fall within different Rating Categories, the Applicable Margin shall be based on the higher of the two ratings, and (iii)&nbsp;the Index Debt Rating established or deemed to have been established by Moody&#146;s and S&amp;P shall
be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody&#146;s or S&amp;P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall
apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody&#146;s or S&amp;P shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, WBA and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency
and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. </P>

Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of WBA that is not guaranteed by any other person or subject to any other credit enhancement. If (i)&nbsp;either Moody&#146;s or S&amp;P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of
the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Rating Category 5; (ii) the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody&#146;s and
S&amp;P for the Index Debt shall fall within different Rating Categories, the Applicable Margin or Applicable Commitment Fee Rate shall be based on the higher of the two ratings, and (iii)&nbsp;the ratings established or deemed to have been
established by Moody&#146;s and S&amp;P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody&#146;s or S&amp;P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the
applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin or Applicable Commitment Fee Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the
next such change. If the rating system of Moody&#146;s or S&amp;P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, WBA and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin or Applicable Commitment Fee Rate shall be determined by reference
to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. </P>
