of 3,191,489 shares of its common stock (the &ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) to the Underwriter and (ii)&nbsp;granted the Underwriter an
option for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 478,723 shares that may be sold upon the exercise of such option by the Underwriter
(the &ldquo;Offering&rdquo;). The Shares were purchased by the Underwriter from the Company at a price of $2.22 per share.</P>

to make because of such liabilities.</P>

prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on February&nbsp;3, 2020, the Company expects net sales to be between $15.2 million and
$15.5 million for the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. As of December&nbsp;31, 2019, the Company had $26.0 million in cash,
cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale. The Company has prepared these estimates in good faith based upon its internal
reporting as of and for the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. Such estimates are preliminary and inherently uncertain
and subject to change as the Company finalizes its financial and operating data for the fourth quarter of 2019. There can be no
assurance that the Company&rsquo;s final results for the fourth quarter of 2019 will not differ materially from these estimates.</P>

nor any of its subsidiaries shall have incurred any material liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into
any material transactions, or declared or paid any dividends or made any distribution of any kind with respect to its capital stock;
and there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than a change in the number of outstanding shares of Common

Change (whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business), or any loss by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident or
other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, incurred by the Company or any subsidiary, the effect of which, in any such
case described above, in your judgment, makes it impractical or inadvisable to offer or deliver the Securities on the terms and

jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such

all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to, or an admission

or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities
referred to in subsection&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above, (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii)&nbsp;if
the allocation provided by clause&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;above but also the relative fault of the Company
on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company
on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received
by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page&nbsp;of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties&rsquo;
relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The
Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;were
to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection&nbsp;(d).
The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence
of this subsection&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection&nbsp;(d).
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection&nbsp;(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the Securities
purchased by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason
of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f)&nbsp;of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&rsquo; obligations in this subsection&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;to contribute are several in
proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section&nbsp;6 are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that might otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.</FONT></P>
