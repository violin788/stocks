purchaser named therein (the &#8220;Purchaser&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a registered direct
offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;), 844,613 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;),
at price of $1.39 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,788,480 shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;Pre-Funded
Warrants&#8221; and the shares of common stock underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants, the &#8220;Warrant Shares&#8221;). The purchase price
of each Pre-Funded Warrant is equal to the price at which a share of Common Stock is sold to the public in this offering, minus $0.0001,
and the exercise price of each Pre-Funded Warrant is $0.0001 per share.</p>

The RD Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and agreements of the Company and the Purchaser and customary
indemnification rights and obligations of the parties.</p>

pre-funded warrants to purchase up to a total of 1,267,897 shares of common stock (the &#8220;PIPE Warrants&#8221;). Each warrant is being
sold at a price of $0.125 per underlying warrant share and will be exercisable at an exercise price of $1.39 per share. The purchase price

comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined in Section 2(d)(i) herein) following the date of exercise as aforesaid, the
Holder shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise by wire
transfer or cashier&#8217;s check drawn on a United States bank unless the cashless exercise procedure specified in Section 2(c)
below is specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise. No ink-original Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any

Exercise within one (1) Trading Day of receipt of such notice. <B>The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant,
acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares
hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the

to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2(d)(i) above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required
by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&#8217;s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares
of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such
exercise (a &#8220;<U>Buy-In</U>&#8221;), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder&#8217;s
total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise
at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the
Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in
which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been
issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common
Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with
an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the
Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable
to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit

Exercise Limitations</U>. The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder&#8217;s Affiliates, and any
other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder&#8217;s Affiliates (such Persons,
 &#8220;<U>Attribution Parties</U>&#8221;)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined
below).&nbsp; For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its
Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with
respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable
upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates
or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the
Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties.&nbsp;
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the
Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the
limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other
securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is
exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the
Holder&#8217;s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the
Company&#8217;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public
announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding.&nbsp; Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Trading Day
confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.&nbsp; In any case, the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the
Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The &#8220;<U>Beneficial Ownership Limitation</U>&#8221; shall be 9.99% of the
number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61<SUP>st</SUP> day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this
paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to
correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership
Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The
limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.</P>

facsimile copy or PDF copy submitted by e-mail (or e-mail attachment) of the Notice of Exercise in the form annexed hereto (the &#8220;<U>Notice

of any Notice of Exercise be required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has

of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant
Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall
maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection

Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant
Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated

Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system (&#8220;<U>DWAC</U>&#8221;) if the Company is then a participant

of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares are eligible for resale by the Holder without volume or manner-of-sale
limitations pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming cashless exercise of the Warrants), and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered
in the Company&#8217;s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder
is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is the earliest
of (i) two (2) Trading Days after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (ii) one (1) Trading Day after delivery of the
aggregate Exercise Price to the Company and (iii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the delivery
to the Company of the Notice of Exercise (such date, the &#8220;<U>Warrant Share Delivery Date</U>&#8221;). Upon delivery of the Notice
of Exercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect
to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant Shares, provided that payment of the aggregate
Exercise Price (other than in the case of a cashless exercise) is received within the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the
number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period following delivery of the Notice of Exercise. If the Company fails for
any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company
shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise
(based on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per
Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share Delivery
Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer agent that is
a participant in the FAST program so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable. As used herein, &#8220;<U>Standard Settlement
Period</U>&#8221; means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company&#8217;s primary Trading
Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Exercise.</P>

to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2(d)(i) above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required
by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&#8217;s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares
of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon
such exercise (a &#8220;<U>Buy-In</U>&#8221;), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x)
the Holder&#8217;s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds
(y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection
with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise
was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the
Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares
of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately
preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating
the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing
herein shall limit a Holder&#8217;s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company&#8217;s failure to timely deliver shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.</P>

<U>Holder&#8217;s Exercise Limitations</U>. The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the
right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder&#8217;s Affiliates, and any other
Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder&#8217;s Affiliates (such Persons, &#8220;<U>Attribution Parties</U>&#8221;)),
would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).&nbsp; For purposes of the foregoing sentence,
the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude
the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant
beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or
nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject
to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its
Affiliates or Attribution Parties.&nbsp; Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the
extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation
to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is
exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder&#8217;s
determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates
and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation,
and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to
any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder
may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company&#8217;s most recent periodic or annual report
filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice
by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.&nbsp; Upon the written or oral request
of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
then outstanding.&nbsp; In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the
conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since
the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The &#8220;<U>Beneficial Ownership Limitation</U>&#8221;
shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number
of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of
this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61<SUP>st</SUP> day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this
paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct
this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein
contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained
in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.</P>

dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return

shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder

one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person (excluding a merger effected
solely to change the Company&#8217;s name), (ii) the Company (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in
one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the
Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares
for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the
Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization
of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for
other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock
or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off,
merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or
party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business
combination) (each a &#8220;<U>Fundamental Transaction</U>&#8221;), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall
have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence
of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this
Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation,
and any additional consideration (the &#8220;<U>Alternate Consideration</U>&#8221;) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction
by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction
(without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant). If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as
to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to
the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder&#8217;s
option, exercisable at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction (or, if later,
the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction), purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the
Holder an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined below) of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on
the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction; provided, however, that if the Fundamental Transaction is not within the
Company's control, including not approved by the Company's Board of Directors, Holder shall only be entitled to receive from the Company
or any Successor Entity the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised
portion of this Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock of the Company in connection with the Fundamental
Transaction, whether that consideration be in the form of cash, stock or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Common Stock
are given the choice to receive from among alternative forms of consideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction; provided,
further, that if holders of Common Stock of the Company are not offered or paid any consideration in such Fundamental Transaction, such
holders of Common Stock will be deemed to have received common stock of the Successor Entity (which Entity may be the Company following
such Fundamental Transaction) in such Fundamental Transaction. &#8220;<U>Black Scholes Value</U>&#8221; means the value of this Warrant
based on the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the &#8220;OV&#8221; function on Bloomberg determined as of the day of
consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest rate corresponding
to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction
and the Termination Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to the greater of 100% and the 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function
on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365-day annualization factor) as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement
of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (C) the underlying price per share used in such calculation shall be the greater of (i) the
sum of the price per share being offered in cash, if any, plus the value of any non-cash consideration, if any, being offered in such
Fundamental Transaction and (ii) the highest VWAP during the period beginning on the Trading Day immediately preceding the announcement
of the applicable Fundamental Transaction (or the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, if earlier) and ending on the
Trading Day of the Holder&#8217;s request pursuant to this Section 3(d) and (D) a remaining option time equal to the time between the
date of the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date and (E) a zero cost of borrow. The
payment of the Black Scholes Value will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or such other consideration) within
the later of (i) five (5) Trading Days of the Holder&#8217;s election and (ii) the date of consummation of the Fundamental Transaction.&nbsp;
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not
the survivor (the &#8220;<U>Successor Entity</U>&#8221;) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant
and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(d) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and
shall, at the option of the Holder, use reasonable best efforts to deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the
Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for
a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common
Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior
to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock
(but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such
shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic
value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to provide that the Successor Entity: (x) shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental
Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the &#8220;Company&#8221; shall refer instead
to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company, and (y) shall assume all of the obligations of the Company
under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company
herein.</P>

for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise</U>. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2(d)(i) above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is
required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&#8217;s brokerage firm otherwise
purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder
anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a &#8220;<U>Buy-In</U>&#8221;), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the
amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder&#8217;s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of
Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was
required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise
to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and
equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded)
or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its
exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of
$11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise
to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay
the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of
the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder&#8217;s right
to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company&#8217;s failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon

Exercise Limitations</U>. The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder&#8217;s Affiliates, and any
other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder&#8217;s Affiliates (such Persons,
 &#8220;<U>Attribution Parties</U>&#8221;)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined
below).&nbsp; For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its
Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with
respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable
upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates
or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the
Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties.&nbsp;
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the
Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the
limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other
securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is
exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the
Holder&#8217;s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the
Company&#8217;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public
announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding.&nbsp; Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day
confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.&nbsp; In any case, the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the
Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The &#8220;<U>Beneficial Ownership Limitation</U>&#8221; shall be 9.99% of the
number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation
provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares
of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the 61<SUP>st</SUP> day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this
paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to
correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership
Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The
limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.</P>

Limitation</U>&#8221; shall be 4.99% (or, at the election of the Purchaser at Closing, 9.99%) of the number of shares of the Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Securities on the Closing Date. The Purchaser&#8217;s

Purchaser its respective Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants as determined pursuant to Section 2.2(a), and the Company and the Purchaser
shall deliver the other items set forth in Section 2.2 deliverable at the Closing. Upon satisfaction of the covenants and conditions
set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the Closing shall occur at the offices of the Placement Agent or such other location as the
parties shall mutually agree. Unless otherwise directed by the Placement Agent, settlement of the Shares shall occur via DVP (i.e.,
on the Closing Date, the Company shall issue the Shares registered in the Purchaser&#8217;s name and address and released by the
Transfer Agent directly to the account(s) at the Placement Agent identified by the Purchaser; upon receipt of such Shares, the
Placement Agent shall promptly electronically deliver such Shares to the Purchaser, and payment therefor shall be made by the
Placement Agent (or its clearing firm) by wire transfer to the Company).</P>

</FONT><U>Internal Accounting Controls</U>. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances that (i)&nbsp;transactions are executed in accordance with management&#8217;s general or specific authorization;
(ii)&nbsp;transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii)&nbsp;access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management&#8217;s general or specific authorization; and (iv)&nbsp;the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing
assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. Except as disclosed in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective and
none of the Company, its board of directors and audit committee is aware of any &#8220;significant deficiencies&#8221; or &#8220;material
weaknesses&#8221; (each as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in its internal control over financial reporting,
or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who have a significant
role in the Company&#8217;s internal controls; and since the end of the latest audited fiscal year, there has been no change in the Company&#8217;s
internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. The Company&#8217;s board of directors has, subject to the exceptions,
cure periods and the phase in periods specified in the applicable stock exchange rules (<I>&#8220;</I><U>Exchange Rules</U><I>&#8221;</I>),
validly appointed an audit committee to oversee internal accounting controls whose composition satisfies the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Rules and the Company&#8217;s board of directors and/or the audit committee has adopted a charter that satisfies the requirements
of the Exchange Rules.</P>

</FONT><U>Solvency</U>. Based on the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the
receipt by the Company of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder and the receipt of $7,500,000 from the offering and sale
of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock to DaVita, Inc., (i) the fair saleable value of the Company&#8217;s assets exceeds the amount
that will be required to be paid on or in respect of the Company&#8217;s existing debts and other liabilities (including known contingent
liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the Company&#8217;s assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as
now conducted and as proposed to be conducted including its capital needs taking into account the particular capital requirements of the
business conducted by the Company, consolidated and projected capital requirements and capital availability thereof, and (iii) the current
cash flow of the Company, together with the proceeds the Company would receive, were it to liquidate all of its assets, after taking into
account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its liabilities when such amounts
are required to be paid. The Company does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account
the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt). The Company has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances
which lead it to believe that it will file for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of any jurisdiction
within one year from the Closing Date. The&nbsp;SEC Reports set forth as of the date hereof all outstanding secured and unsecured Indebtedness
of the Company or any subsidiary, or for which the Company or any subsidiary has commitments. For the purposes of this Agreement, &#8220;<U>Indebtedness</U>&#8221;
means (x) any liabilities for borrowed money or amounts owed in excess of $50,000 (other than trade accounts payable incurred in the ordinary
course of business), (y) all guaranties, endorsements and other contingent obligations in respect of indebtedness of others, whether or
not the same are or should be reflected in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) or disclosed the SEC
Reports, except guaranties by endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection or similar transactions in the ordinary
course of business; and (z) the present value of any lease payments in excess of $50,000 due under leases required to be capitalized in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary is in default with respect
to any Indebtedness.</P>

against any Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall
promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own
choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any

a Purchaser Party effected without the Company&#8217;s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
or (2) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party&#8217;s
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in the

thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The indemnity agreements
contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Purchaser Party against the Company or others

The capitalization of the Company as of the date hereof is as set forth on <U>Schedule 3.1(g)</U>. The Company has not issued any

pursuant to the Company&#8217;s employee stock purchase plans and pursuant to the conversion and/or exercise of Common Stock
Equivalents outstanding as of the date of the most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act. No Person has any right of
first refusal, preemptive right, right of participation, or any similar right to participate in the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents. Except as a result of the purchase and sale of the Securities hereunder and under the RD Offering, as well as
the offering and sale of $7,500,000 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock to DaVita, Inc., there are no outstanding
options, warrants, scrip rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to, or securities, rights
or obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or giving any Person any right to subscribe for or acquire, any
shares of Common Stock or the capital stock of any Subsidiary, or contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
the Company or any Subsidiary is or may become bound to issue additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or
capital stock of any Subsidiary. The issuance and sale of the Securities will not obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to issue
shares of Common Stock or other securities to any Person (other than the Purchasers). There are no outstanding securities or
instruments of the Company or any Subsidiary with any provision that adjusts the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price of
such security or instrument upon an issuance of securities by the Company or any Subsidiary. Except the Series X Convertible
Preferred Stock, there are no outstanding securities or instruments of the Company or any Subsidiary that contain any redemption or
similar provisions, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the Company or any Subsidiary
is or may become bound to redeem a security of the Company or such Subsidiary. The Company does not have any stock appreciation
rights or &#8220;phantom stock&#8221; plans or agreements or any similar plan or agreement. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, have been issued in compliance with all
federal and state securities laws, and none of such outstanding shares was issued in violation of any preemptive rights or similar
rights to subscribe for or purchase securities. No further approval or authorization of any stockholder, the Board of Directors or
others is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities. There are no stockholders agreements, voting agreements or other
similar agreements with respect to the Company&#8217;s capital stock to which the Company is a party or, to the knowledge of the
Company, between or among any of the Company&#8217;s stockholders.</P>

Based on the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the receipt by the
Company of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder, the receipt of the proceeds from the RD Offering, and the
offering and sale of $7,500,000 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock to DaVita, Inc., (i) the fair saleable value of the
Company&#8217;s assets exceeds the amount that will be required to be paid on or in respect of the Company&#8217;s existing debts
and other liabilities (including known contingent liabilities) as they mature, (ii) the Company&#8217;s assets do not constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted including its capital needs
taking into account the particular capital requirements of the business conducted by the Company, consolidated and projected capital
requirements and capital availability thereof, and (iii) the current cash flow of the Company, together with the proceeds the
Company would receive, were it to liquidate all of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash, would be
sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its liabilities when such amounts are required to be paid. The Company does not
intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be
payable on or in respect of its debt). The Company has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances which lead it to believe that it
will file for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of any jurisdiction within one year from the
Closing Date. <U>The SEC Reports </U>set forth as of the date hereof all outstanding secured and unsecured Indebtedness of the
Company or any Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Subsidiary has commitments. For the purposes of this Agreement,
 &#8220;<U>Indebtedness</U>&#8221; means (x) any liabilities for borrowed money or amounts owed in excess of $50,000 (other than
trade accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business), (y) all guaranties, endorsements and other contingent
obligations in respect of indebtedness of others, whether or not the same are or should be reflected in the Company&#8217;s
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto), except guaranties by endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or
collection or similar transactions in the ordinary course of business; and (z) the present value of any lease payments in excess of
$50,000 due under leases required to be capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default
with respect to any Indebtedness.</P>
