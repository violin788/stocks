Letter. Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;7.01 and Section&nbsp;7.0<U>2</U>, as of the
date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing to be satisfied
by Clearwater LLC will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Clearwater LLC on the Closing
Date in an amount sufficient, together with cash on&#8239;hand of Parent and the Company, to pay the Required Amount. The non-redacted portion
of the Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent and other conditions to the obligations of the parties thereunder
to make the Debt Financing available to Parent (or its Affiliate party thereto) on the terms therein. As of the date hereof, other than
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter, there are no side letters or other agreements to which Parent
or any of its Affiliates is a party that would reasonably be expected to reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of the Debt Financing
such that the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, taken together with cash on hand of Parent and the Company, would be below the
Required Amount or materially delay the funding thereof.</P>

received by reason of the Reorganization under Section&nbsp;356 of the Code (the &ldquo;<B><U>Intended Tax Treatment</U></B>&rdquo;).
The TRA Payment Recipients, on the one hand, and the purchaser in the Qualifying Change of Control and the Corporate Taxpayer, on the
other hand, (i)&nbsp;shall promptly provide each other with such additional information and assistance as reasonably requested by the
other party in connection with tax reporting matters relating to the payments contemplated by this Amendment, and (ii)&nbsp;shall cooperate
in good faith after the date hereof (but prior to the consummation of the Qualifying Change of Control) to allocate the Final TRA Payments
among each of the categories set forth in clauses (a)&nbsp;through (c)&nbsp;above. As part of the Intended Tax Treatment, the Final TRA
Payments hereunder will be further allocated to and among the assets of Opco for purposes of Section&nbsp;743 and Section&nbsp;755 of
the Code and otherwise as required for purposes of the Code as reasonably determined by the Corporate Taxpayer consistent with the applicable
provisions of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Intended Tax Treatment hereunder and shall not take a position on any Tax Return or in connection with any administrative or judicial
or similar proceeding in respect of Taxes that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment, except as otherwise required by a determination

 &ndash; January&nbsp;13, 2025 &ndash;</B> <U>Clearwater Analytics</U> (NYSE: CWAN) (&ldquo;Clearwater&rdquo;) and Enfusion,&nbsp;Inc.
(NYSE: ENFN) (&ldquo;Enfusion&rdquo;) today announced their entry into a definitive merger agreement for Clearwater to acquire Enfusion,
a leader in software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for the investment management and hedge fund industry. The purchase price is $11.25
per share, delivered in an approximately equal mix of cash and stock. Additionally, Clearwater will pay $30 million to terminate Enfusion&rsquo;s
tax receivable agreement (TRA). This equates to a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement is
about creating a future where our clients benefit from the synergy of two highly complementary, innovative software leaders, paving the
way for a unified, cloud-native front-to-back platform that&rsquo;s primed to serve institutional investors like never before. We expect
to accelerate growth based on our increased right-to-win, higher back-to-base sales, greater presence across key geographies and increased
Total Addressable Market (TAM). Coupled with our operating rigor and use of Generative AI, we have high confidence that we can drive
meaningfully improved unit economics at Enfusion while also growing its emerging managed services business,&rdquo; said Sandeep Sahai,
CEO of Clearwater Analytics. &ldquo;Most importantly, this acquisition enables seamless data management from the front office to the
back office, unlocking powerful network effects that amplify client value.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Strategic Rationale</B></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition of Enfusion accelerates
Clearwater&rsquo;s vision of building the first cloud-native front-to-back platform for the entire investment management industry:</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Front-to-Back Platform Leadership:
</B>Enfusion&rsquo;s front-office capabilities&mdash;including IBOR, portfolio and order management&mdash;will be integrated with Clearwater&rsquo;s
middle and back-office solutions and client reporting capabilities to enable a unified, cloud-native platform that seamlessly integrates
with other technologies. This will allow clients to avoid the error-prone data handoff that happens between the front, middle and back
office, which in turn creates major reconciliation issues resulting in inefficiencies, inaccuracies and increased risk.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Enhanced Right to Win in Asset
Management:</B> Approximately two-thirds of Clearwater&rsquo;s core TAM comes from the asset management industry, but the company
derives only one-third of its revenue from it. Enfusion has developed a next-generation platform for asset managers, starting its
innovation in the front office. Clearwater, on a parallel journey, has built a disruptive platform focused on the middle and back
office, specifically in data ingestion, aggregation, accounting, compliance, regulatory reporting, and comprehensive client
reporting. By combining both sets of solutions and engineering expertise, Clearwater aims to significantly enhance its right to win
with asset managers across various segments, geographies, and sizes.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Expanded Capabilities for Clients:
</B>With very high levels of client satisfaction, as reflected in Clearwater&rsquo;s high NPS score, the company has consistently been
asked to do more in adjacent segments of its workflow. With this combination, Clearwater&rsquo;s clients in the insurance, asset management,
and asset allocator sectors&mdash;including corporations, governments, pensions, endowments, foundations and REITs&mdash; will, in due
course, benefit from seamlessly integrating Enfusion&rsquo;s IBOR and its portfolio and order management software with the Clearwater
platform. We expect this to accelerate Clearwater&rsquo;s journey from 1 basis point to 4 basis points (bps) journey and improve net
revenue retention.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Increased TAM and Hedge Fund Leadership:
</B>The acquisition positions Clearwater to expand into the hedge fund industry. Enfusion has an outstanding track record and wide acceptance
as the leading end- to-end platform for hedge funds and more broadly, liquid alternatives. By adding dedicated engineering, product,
and client operations teams, Clearwater aims to accelerate growth and drive greater innovation within the industry. This expansion is
expected to increase the company&rsquo;s TAM by $1.9 billion.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Global Growth Opportunities:</B>
The international markets make up approximately 50% of Clearwater&rsquo;s TAM but the company derives less than 18% of its revenue from
outside the U.S. Enfusion&rsquo;s strong international presence, with 38% of its revenue generated in Europe and Asia, is expected to
accelerate Clearwater&rsquo;s global adoption strategy. Having a significantly higher presence across these geographies will strengthen
Clearwater&rsquo;s ability to expand internationally.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B>Significant
Synergy Opportunity:</B> The combination presents significant synergy opportunities across multiple fronts. Clearwater believes it will
help accelerate Enfusion&rsquo;s growth based on the increased right-to-win, back-to-base sales, greater presence across geographies,
and increased TAM.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Secondly, Clearwater has built a highly
robust execution infrastructure across New Delhi, Edinburgh and Boise that operates effectively and at scale. Over the past few years,
Clearwater&rsquo;s operating rigor and its ability to harness Generative AI has allowed the company to aggressively improve gross margin
while improving customer satisfaction. Clearwater expects to bring those skills to Enfusion and has very high confidence of driving meaningfully
improved unit economics, while also growing their emerging managed services business.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">And thirdly, Clearwater expects considerable
efficiencies in general and administrative expenses, yielding about $20 million in cost savings, which we believe will be delivered over
the first two and a half years after close. In the Enfusion business specifically, Clearwater expects to deliver 400 bps in Adjusted
EBITDA margin expansion in the first year after close and an additional 400 bps in the second year after close.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&ldquo;This transaction marks an
exciting new chapter for all of Enfusion&rsquo;s key stakeholders. Since our inception, we have proven that the versatility, scale,
and depth of our solutions captures the hearts and minds of both traditional and alternative investment managers. Together with
Clearwater, our shared passion for building innovative technologies and enriching every aspect of the client journey will now
accelerate and enhance our combined ability to support our clients&rsquo; evolving needs&ndash;whether they are expanding into new
strategies, asset classes, or geographies. That commitment will ensure our clients remain on the cutting edge of investment
management technology,&rdquo; said Oleg Movchan, CEO of Enfusion.</FONT></P>

process to determine the best path to maximizing value for all Enfusion shareholders. Our review of potential strategic alternatives
for Enfusion was led by a Special Committee composed of independent directors and advised by independent legal and financial advisors.
We are pleased to have reached an agreement that will both deliver significant and immediate value to Enfusion&rsquo;s shareholders,
and, together with Clearwater, provide our shareholders and employees with the opportunity to participate in meaningful potential upside.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The merger agreement has been unanimously
approved by a Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Enfusion, consisting of directors independent of Enfusion&rsquo;s TRA holders,
as well as by the Boards of Directors of both companies. Certain shareholders of Enfusion affiliated with FTV,&nbsp;ICONIQ and Mr.&nbsp;Movchan,
collectively holding approximately 45% of Enfusion&rsquo;s total voting power, have entered into voting and support agreements in favor
of the transaction. The transaction is anticipated to close in Q2 of 2025, subject to approval by Enfusion shareholders, the receipt
of required regulatory approvals, and customary closing conditions.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">&ldquo;Building on the momentum of our
strong Q3 2024 results, we continue to see strong business momentum in Q4, and we are confident in our ability to meet and exceed the

These achievements reflect the durability of our business model and our disciplined approach to growth, which positions us to execute
this transformative acquisition effectively. With Enfusion, we are taking a bold step forward, uniting two innovative platforms that

Enfusion shareholders will receive consideration equal to $11.25 per share consisting of $5.85 per share in cash and $5.40 per share

day prior to the closing date (the &ldquo;Final Parent Stock Price&rdquo;) is below $25.01, then Enfusion shareholders will receive

then Enfusion shareholders will receive 0.1766 shares of Clearwater Class&nbsp;A Common Stock per share of Enfusion Class&nbsp;A

management and on information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include information concerning the following factors
in reference to Clearwater and/or Enfusion: the timing of the consummation of the acquisition and the ability to satisfy closing conditions,
possible or assumed future results of operations, possible or assumed performance, business strategies, technology developments, financing
and investment plans, competitive position, industry, economic and regulatory environment, potential growth opportunities and the effects
of competition. Forward-looking statements include statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;aim,&rdquo; &ldquo;may,&rdquo;

and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond Clearwater&rsquo;s and Enfusion&rsquo;s control, that may
cause their actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability to
successfully close the acquisition, Clearwater&rsquo;s ability to successfully integrate the operations and technology of Enfusion with
those of Clearwater, retain and incentivize the employees of Enfusion following the close of the acquisition, retain Enfusion&rsquo;s
clients, repay debt to be incurred in connection with the Enfusion acquisition and meet financial covenants to be imposed in connection
with such debt, risks that cost savings, synergies and growth from the acquisition may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize
than expected, the finalization and audit of Enfusion&rsquo;s 2024 fiscal year financial results which could potentially result in changes
or adjustments to the preliminary financial results presented herein, as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed under &ldquo;Risk
Factors&rdquo; in Clearwater&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 filed with the US Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) on February&nbsp;29, 2024 and in Enfusion&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March&nbsp;12, 2024, as well as in other periodic reports filed by Clearwater
and Enfusion with the SEC. These filings are available at www.sec.gov and on Clearwater&rsquo;s website, investors.clearwateranalytics.com,
and Enfusion&rsquo;s website, ir.enfusion.com. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Also, forward-looking statements represent management&rsquo;s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release and should
not be relied upon as representing Clearwater&rsquo;s or Enfusion&rsquo;s expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the time
they are made. Each of Clearwater and Enfusion does not undertake to and specifically declines any obligation to update any forward-looking
