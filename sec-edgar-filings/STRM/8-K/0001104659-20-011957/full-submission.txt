and Executive&rsquo;s employment hereunder for Good Cause, Executive may at any time terminate his employment other than for Good
Reason (as defined in Section 11(d) herein), or Executive may notify the Company that he will not renew the Term. For this purpose,
 &ldquo;<U>Good Cause</U>&rdquo; will include the following: the current use of illegal drugs; conviction of any crime which involves
moral turpitude, fraud or misrepresentation; commission of any act which would constitute a felony or which adversely impacts the
business or reputation of the Company; fraud; misappropriation or embezzlement of Company funds or property; willful misconduct
or grossly negligent or reckless conduct which is materially injurious to the reputation, business or business relationships of

reasonable performance criteria or reasonable standards of conduct as established from time to time by the Board, which failure
continues for at least thirty (30) days after written notice from the Company to Executive. Notice of a termination by the Company
for Good Cause will be delivered in writing to Executive stating the Good Cause for such action. If the employment of Executive
is terminated by the Company for Good Cause, if Executive terminates employment for any reason other than for Good Reason (including,

</FONT></FONT><U>Termination by the Company without Good Cause or by Executive for Good Reason</U>. The Company may terminate this
Agreement and Executive&rsquo;s employment at any time, including for reasons other than Good Cause (as &ldquo;<U>Good Cause</U>&rdquo;
is defined in Section 11(c) above), Executive may terminate his employment at any time, including for Good Reason, or the Company
may elect not to renew the Term. For the purposes herein, &ldquo;<U>Good Reason</U>&rdquo; will mean (i) a material diminution
of Executive&rsquo;s base salary; (ii) a material diminution in Executive&rsquo;s authority, duties, or responsibilities; or (iii)
any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach of the terms of this Agreement; provided that Executive&rsquo;s
termination will not be treated as for Good Reason unless Executive provides the Company with notice of the existence of the condition
claimed to constitute Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such condition and the Company fails to remedy
such condition within thirty (30) days following the Company&rsquo;s receipt of such notice. In the event that (i) the Company
terminates the employment of Executive during the Term for reasons other than for Good Cause, death or Continued Disability or
(ii) Executive terminates employment for Good Reason, then the Company will pay Executive the sum of (A) accrued but unpaid salary
through the termination date paid in accordance with the normal practices of the Company, (B) expenses incurred by Executive prior
to his termination date for which Executive is entitled to reimbursement under (and paid in accordance with) Section 4 herein,
and (C) provided that Executive is not in default of his obligations under Section 7, 8, or 9 herein, an amount equal to twelve
(12) months&rsquo; base salary ((A) through (C), being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the &ldquo;<U>Separation Benefits</U>&rdquo;).
In such event, the payments described in (C) in the preceding sentence will be made following Executive&rsquo;s execution (and
non-revocation) of a form of general release of claims as is acceptable to the Board or the Committee if the general release form
is provided to the Executive within one (1) month of the Executive&rsquo;s date of termination, in accordance with the normal payroll
practices of the Company; provided that the portion of the severance payment described in clause (C) above that exceeds the &ldquo;separation
pay limit,&rdquo; if any, will be paid to the Executive in a lump sum payment within thirty (30) days following the date of Executive&rsquo;s
termination of employment (or such earlier date following the date of Executive&rsquo;s termination of employment, if any, as may
be required under applicable wage payment laws), but in no event later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month following
the Executive&rsquo;s date of termination. The &ldquo;<U>separation pay limit</U>&rdquo; will mean two (2) times the lesser of:
(1) the sum of Executive's annualized compensation based upon the annual rate of pay for services provided to the Company for the
calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which Executive's date of termination of employment occurs (adjusted for
any increase during that calendar year that was expected to continue indefinitely if Executive had not terminated employment);
and (2) the maximum dollar amount of compensation that may be taken into account under a tax-qualified retirement plan under Code
Section 401(a)(17) for the year in which his termination of employment occurs. The lump-sum payment to be made to Executive pursuant
to this Section 11(d) is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the exemption found in Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)
for short-term deferrals. The remaining portion of the severance payment described in clause (C) above will be paid in periodic
installments over the fifteen (15)-month period commencing on the first post-termination payroll date following expiration of the
revocation period described above and will be paid in accordance with the normal payroll practices of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event will such remaining portion of the severance payment described in clause (C) above be paid to Executive
later than December 31 of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive's date of termination of employment
occurs. The payments to be made to Executive pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are intended to be exempt from Code
Section 409A under the exemption found in Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) for separation pay plans (<I>i.e., </I>the so-called
 &ldquo;two times&rdquo; pay exemption). For the sake of clarity, no election by the Company not to renew the Term will trigger
any rights to severance or other benefits.</P>

</FONT></FONT><U>Payment of COBRA Premiums</U>. In the event that the Company terminates Executive&rsquo;s employment for any reason
other than Good Cause or Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, then, provided that Executive timely elects to receive
continued coverage under the Company&rsquo;s group medical and dental insurance plans pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended (&ldquo;<U>COBRA</U>&rdquo;), for the period commencing on the date of Executive&rsquo;s
termination and continuing until the earlier of the end of the six (6)-month period following his termination date or the first
of the month immediately following the Company&rsquo;s receipt of notice from Executive terminating such coverage, Executive (and
any qualified dependents) will be entitled to coverage under such plans (as may be amended during the period of coverage) in which
Executive was participating immediately prior to the date of his termination of employment (the &ldquo;<U>COBRA Coverage</U>&rdquo;).
The cost of the premiums for such coverage will be borne by the Company, except that Executive will reimburse the Company for premiums
becoming due each month with respect to such coverage in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of such premiums
and the portion thereof currently being paid by Executive. Executive&rsquo;s portion of such premiums will be payable by the first
of each month commencing the first month following the month in which his termination of employment occurs. The period during which
Executive is being provided with health insurance under this Agreement at the Company&rsquo;s expense will be credited against
Executive&rsquo;s period of COBRA coverage, if any. Further, if at any time during the period Executive is entitled to premium
payments under this Section 11(e), Executive becomes entitled to receive health insurance from a subsequent employer, the Company&rsquo;s
obligation to continue premium payments to Executive shall terminate immediately.</P>

other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent that Code Section 409A is deemed to apply to any benefit
under this Agreement, it is the general intention of the Company that such benefits will, to the extent practicable, comply with,
or be exempt from, Code Section 409A, and this Agreement will, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith.
Deferrals of benefits distributable pursuant to this Agreement that are otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A in a manner that
would cause Code Section 409A to apply will not be permitted unless such deferrals follow Code Section 409A. In the event that
the Company (or a successor thereto) has any stock which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise and
Executive is determined to be a &ldquo;<U>specified employee</U>&rdquo; (as defined under Code Section 409A), any payment that
is deemed to be deferred compensation under Code Section 409A to be made to the Executive upon a separation from service may not
be made before the date that is six (6) months after Executive&rsquo;s separation from service (or death, if earlier). To the extent
that Executive becomes subject to the six (6)-month delay rule, all payments that would have been made to Executive during the
six (6) months following his separation from service that are not otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A, if any, will be accumulated
and paid to Executive during the seventh (7th) month following his separation from service, and any remaining payments due will
be made in their ordinary course as described in this Agreement. For the purposes herein, the phrase &ldquo;<U>termination of employment</U>&rdquo;
or similar phrases will be interpreted in accordance with the term &ldquo;<U>separation from service</U>&rdquo; as defined under
Code Section 409A if and to the extent required under Code Section 409A. Further, (i) in the event that Code Section 409A requires
that any special terms, provisions or conditions be included in this Agreement, then such terms, provisions and conditions will,
to the extent practicable, be deemed to be made a part of this Agreement, and (ii) terms used in this Agreement will be construed
in accordance with Code Section 409A if and to the extent required. Further, in the event that this Agreement or any benefit thereunder
will be deemed not to comply with Code Section 409A, then neither the Company, the Board, the Committee nor its or their designees
or agents will be liable to any participant or other person for actions, decisions or determinations made in good faith.</P>
