</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;29, 2008, clickNsettle.com, Inc. (&#147;CKST&#148;) completed an acquisition of Cardo Medical, LLC,
a privately held California limited liability company (&#147;Cardo&#148;), and its subsidiaries pursuant to a
Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of June&nbsp;18, 2008, as amended, by and among
CKST, Cardo and Cardo Acquisition, LLC, a California limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of CKST.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Cardo with and into Cardo Acquisition, LLC, with
Cardo continuing as the surviving entity in the merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CKST
(referred to as the &#147;Merger&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on June&nbsp;23, 2008, on or about the signing of the Merger Agreement, Frost Gamma
Investments Trust and other investors invested $12.975&nbsp;million in Cardo in exchange for units of
Cardo&#146;s membership interests. Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Opko
Health, Inc. (formerly known as eXegenics Inc.), is the trustee and beneficiary of Frost Gamma
Investments Trust. Cardo used approximately $9.7&nbsp;million of the proceeds from these investments to
close on the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests of three partially owned subsidiaries
of Cardo (Accelerated Innovation, LLC, Cervical Xpand, LLC and Uni-Knee, LLC), to repay an existing
member loan (in the amount of $1.2&nbsp;million) and for transaction expenses, and expects to use the
remaining funds to accelerate its research and product development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, each Cardo unit issued and
outstanding was converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 667,204.70995 shares of
common stock of CKST. As a result of the Merger, CKST&#146;s
shareholders and optionholders own approximately 5.5% of the
combined company on a fully diluted basis (or 11,298,979 shares of
common stock outstanding and underlying options), the members of
Cardo, excluding the new investors, own approximately 64.8% of the combined company on a fully
diluted basis (or 133,440,942 shares of common stock), the new investors own approximately 28.5% of
the combined company on a fully diluted basis (or 58,641,701 shares of common stock), and optionholders
of Cardo own approximately 1.2% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis (or
2,398,400 shares of common stock underlying those options).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the consummation of the Merger, CKST will propose to its shareholders an
amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name from &#147;clickNsettle.com, Inc.&#148; to
&#147;Cardo Medical, Inc.&#148; CKST&#146;s trading symbol is &#147;CKST.OB,&#148; which we expect to change in connection
with the name change. CKST intends to apply to have its shares listed on the American Stock
Exchange. We cannot ensure that we will be able to satisfy the listing standards of the American
Stock Exchange or that our common stock will be accepted for listing.

prior to the admission of the new investors) will be held in escrow by a third-party escrow agent

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This Current Report on Form 8-K, including the disclosures in accordance with Form&nbsp;10, contain
&#147;forward-looking statements,&#148; as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, or the PSLRA. Forward-looking statements include statements about our
expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding our product development efforts, business, financial
condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking
statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current
matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities,
trends or results as of the date they are made. Without limiting the foregoing, the words
&#147;believes,&#148; &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;expects&#148; and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements
are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described under
the caption &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in Item&nbsp;1A of these Form&nbsp;10 disclosures, some of which are briefly
listed below. Other factors besides those listed there also could adversely affect us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K may turn out to be
wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks
and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this Current Report on Form 8-K
will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be
guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially. While we may elect to update these
forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to
do so to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting
forward-looking statements. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the
safe-harbor provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and
reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial
performance.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">clickNsettle.com, Inc., or CKST, was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January&nbsp;12, 1994.
CKST previously was involved in the business of providing alternative dispute resolution, or ADR,
services. On October&nbsp;31, 1994, CKST acquired all of the outstanding common stock of its
predecessor operating company, which was formed on February&nbsp;6, 1992, and was primarily owned by its
former Chief Executive Officer and President. CKST&#146;s predecessor began operations in March&nbsp;1992 as
a provider of ADR services. CKST&#146;s predecessor was merged into CKST as of the end of June&nbsp;1999.
In June&nbsp;2000, CKST&#146;s name was changed from &#147;NAM Corporation&#148; to &#147;clickNsettle.com, Inc.&#148; CKST
ceased all operations relating to its historical ADR business in January&nbsp;2005 when it sold that
business to National Arbitration and Mediation, Inc., a company owned by CKST&#146;s former Chief
Executive Officer. From the consummation of the sale of the ADR business and until the closing of
the Merger, CKST had no operating business. As such, prior to the Merger, CKST was a publicly
traded shell company actively searching for a new operating business to acquire or to enter into a
merger transaction. Upon consummation of the Merger, CKST adopted Cardo&#146;s business plan, which is
now CKST&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary. You should read the discussion below in conjunction with
CKST&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the pro forma financial
statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Information about Cardo Medical, LLC and Its Subsidiaries</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Overview</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cardo Medical, LLC is an early-stage orthopedic medical device company specializing in designing,
developing and marketing reconstructive joint devices and spinal surgical devices. Reconstructive
joint devices are used to replace knee, hip and other joints that have deteriorated through disease
or injury. Spinal surgical devices involve products to stabilize the spine for fusion and
reconstructive procedures. Within these areas, Cardo intends to focus on the higher-growth sectors
of the orthopedic industry, such as advanced minimally invasive instrumentation and bone-conserving
high-performance implants. Cardo is focused on developing surgical devices that will enable
surgeons to bridge the gap between soft tissue-driven sports medicine techniques and classical
reconstructive surgical procedures. Cardo commercializes its reconstructive joint devices through
its Cardo Orthopedics division and its spine devices through its Cardo Spine division.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2006, Cardo initiated sales of the Align 360 unicompartmental knee device, a partial
knee resurfacing device for the medial or lateral part of the knee. Cardo has received approval
under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#147;Section&nbsp;510(k)&#148;) for its uniquely
instrumented patello-femoral arthroplasty, a resurfacing device for the back of the kneecap, as
well as for its total hip replacement system and its monopolar and bipolar hip systems. Cardo also
have received Section 510(k) approvals for its spinal lumbar fusion system and its cervical plate
and screw systems. Cardo is actively engaged in a number of research and development projects for
total knee arthroplasty, spinal motion preservation, fusion devices and minimally invasive
approaches for treating an array of spinal disorders.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of Accelerated&#146;s Limited Liability Company Agreement, Cardo was granted an option
to purchase the 62.5% interest in Accelerated held by Accin for a purchase price of $6.25&nbsp;million.
Following the exercise of that option in June&nbsp;2008, Cardo acquired all of the interests in
Accelerated held by Accin, and Accelerated became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardo.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to that, in February&nbsp;2008, Cardo entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreements with
the holders of the minority membership interests in Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee. Cervical Xpand
and Uni-Knee were formed as New Jersey limited liability companies on July&nbsp;12, 2005 and May&nbsp;10,
2006, respectively, for the purpose of conducting research and development activities. Prior to
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreements,
Accelerated, as the assignee of Accin&#146;s assets, owned 52.083% of the membership interests in
Cervical Xpand and 51.21% of the membership interests in Uni-Knee, and the minority holders held
the remaining outstanding interests. Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Membership Interest Purchase Agreements, in June&nbsp;2008, Cardo acquired the outstanding membership
interests from the minority holders for an aggregate purchase price of $1,437,510 for the Cervical
Xpand interests and $2,049,180 for the Uni-Knee interests. As a result, Cardo now owns all of the
interests in Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee directly and indirectly through its ownership of
Accelerated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;18, 2008, Cardo entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with CKST and
Cardo Acquisition, LLC, a California limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of CKST.
Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, CKST acquired
Cardo through a merger of Cardo with Cardo Acquisition, with Cardo continuing as the surviving
entity in the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CKST. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all
of the issued and outstanding units of Cardo&#146;s membership interests were converted into the right
to receive shares of the common stock of CKST.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On or
about  the signing of the Merger Agreement, Frost Gamma Investments Trust and other
investors invested $12.975&nbsp;million in Cardo in exchange for units of Cardo&#146;s membership interests.
Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Opko Health, Inc. (formerly known as
eXegenics Inc.), is the trustee and beneficiary of Frost Gamma Investments Trust. Cardo used
approximately $9.7&nbsp;million of the proceeds from these investments to close on the acquisition of
the outstanding equity interests of three partially owned subsidiaries of Cardo (Accelerated
Innovation, LLC, Cervical Xpand, LLC and Uni-Knee, LLC), to repay an existing member loan (in the
amount of $1.2&nbsp;million) and for transaction expenses, and expects to use the remaining funds to
accelerate its research and product development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, as of the closing of the Merger, CKST had cash and cash equivalents in the approximate
amount of $2.5&nbsp;million held in money market accounts and certificates of deposit, which is now
available for use in our business due to the Merger. In total, following the Merger, the combined
company currently has $4.7&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, each Cardo unit issued and
outstanding was converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 667,204.70995 shares of
common stock of CKST. As a result of the Merger, CKST&#146;s
shareholders and optionholders own approximately 5.5% of the
combined company on a fully diluted basis (or 11,298,979 shares of
common stock outstanding and underlying options), the members of
Cardo, excluding the new investors, own approximately 64.8% of the combined company on a fully
diluted basis (or 133,440,942 shares of common stock), the new investors own approximately 28.5% of
the combined company on a fully diluted basis (or 58,641,701 shares of common stock), and optionholders of Cardo own approximately 1.2% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis (or
2,398,400 shares of common stock underlying those options).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Ten days following the filing and transmission to shareholders of the Information Statement
(approximately September&nbsp;19, 2008), our Board of Directors will consist of five directors
originally designated by Andrew A. Brooks, M.D. and two directors originally designated by Phillip
Frost, M.D. Dr.&nbsp;Brooks, an orthopedic surgeon, will serve as the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of the combined company on the tenth day after we file and transmit the
Information Statement. In the future, our directors will be designated by our shareholders.
However, given that a few shareholders together own a majority of our common stock, they will be
able to elect a majority of the directors of CKST.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are headquartered in Los Angeles, California. In connection with the consummation of the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">According to the 2007-2008 Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report published by Knowledge Enterprises,
Inc., which we refer to herein as the Industry Annual Report, the worldwide market for orthopedic
products in 2007 was estimated to be $32.5&nbsp;billion, representing an 11.8% increase from the
previous year. According to this report, bone and joint diseases account for half of all the
chronic conditions in people over 50&nbsp;years of age. With the predicted doubling of the aged
population by the year 2020, the report suggests that demographics alone will drive growth in the
global orthopedic industry. We also believe that the orthopedic industry will continue to grow due
to an increasingly older population and extended life spans in the Unites States and other
developed countries worldwide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">According to the Industry Annual Report, the world&#146;s six largest replacement companies&#151;Zimmer,
Johnson &#038; Johnson, Stryker, Smith &#038; Nephew, Biomet and Wright Medical&#151;generated 89% of joint
product sales in 2007. We believe that the size of these companies often leads them to concentrate
their marketing and research and development efforts on products that they believe will have a
relatively high minimum threshold level of sales. As a result, there is an opportunity for a
smaller orthopedic company, such as us, to focus on smaller, higher-growth sectors of the
orthopedic market, while still offering a comprehensive product line to address the needs of its
customers in a customized and interactive fashion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Orthopedic devices are commonly divided into several primary sectors corresponding to the major
subspecialties within the orthopedic field: reconstruction, trauma, arthroscopy, spine and
biologics. Management&#146;s initial focus is on innovation related to reconstructive joint devices and
spinal products, as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Reconstructive Joint Device Market</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Most reconstructive joint devices are used to replace or repair joints that have deteriorated as a
result of disease or injury. Despite the availability of non-surgical treatment alternatives such
as oral medications, injections and joint fluid supplementation of the knee, severe cases of
disease or injury often require reconstructive joint surgery.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Reconstructive joint surgery involves modifying the bone area surrounding the affected joint and
inserting one or more manufactured components, and also may involve using bone cement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The reconstructive joint device market is generally divided into the areas of hips, knees and
extremities. According to the Industry Annual Report, it is estimated that the worldwide
reconstructive joint device market had sales of approximately $11.6&nbsp;billion in 2007, with hip
reconstruction and knee reconstruction representing the largest sectors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Knee Reconstruction</I>. The knee joint involves the surfaces of three distinct bones: the lower end
of the femur, or thigh bone, the upper end of the tibia, or shin bone, and the patella, or kneecap.
Cartilage on any of these surfaces can be damaged due to disease or injury, leading to pain and
inflammation requiring knee reconstruction. According to the Industry Annual Report, knee
reconstruction was the largest sector of the reconstructive joint device market in 2007, with
estimated sales of approximately $5.9&nbsp;billion worldwide.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">One of the major trends in knee reconstruction includes the use of minimally invasive techniques to
accomplish reconstructive goals with less damage to surrounding soft tissues. Our unicompartmental
device has been designed to be inserted through small incision surgery with an innovative
instrumentation approach. Our design approach was to develop an innovative instrumentation system
to improve and simplify surgical technique for a clinically proven implant concept. We believe
that our system allows the surgeon to simply and reproducibly balance both flexion and extension
gaps. This is a general approach we plan to continue with our other products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Hip Reconstruction. </I>The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint that enables the large range of
motion that the hip performs in daily life. The hip joint is most commonly replaced due to
degeneration of the cartilage between the head of the femur (the ball) and the acetabulum or hollow
portion of the pelvis (the socket). This degeneration causes pain, stiffness and a reduction in
hip mobility. According to the Industry Annual Report, it is estimated that the worldwide hip
reconstruction market had sales of approximately $5.1&nbsp;billion in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Similar to the knee reconstruction market, major trends in hip replacement procedures and implants
are to extend implant life and to preserve bone stock for possible future procedures. New products
have been developed that incorporate advances in bearing surfaces from the traditional polyethylene
surface. These alternative bearing surfaces include metal-on-metal, cross-linked polyethylene and
ceramic-on-ceramic combinations, which exhibit improved wear characteristics and lead to longer
implant life. In addition to advances in bearing surfaces, implants that preserve more natural
bone have been developed in order to minimize surgical trauma and recovery time for patients.
These implants, known as bone-conserving implants, leave more of the hip bones intact, which may be
beneficial given the likelihood of future revision replacement procedures as the average patient&#146;s
lifetime increases. Bone-conserving procedures are intended to enable patients to delay their
first total hip procedure and may significantly increase the time from the first procedure to the
time when a revision replacement implant is required. Our hip product portfolio, currently
consisting of three products, is focused on improving the surgical techniques for bone-conservative
procedures. These products integrate implant designs that are based on predicate devices (<I>i.e.</I>, a
device with a similar design that has already received clearance) with successful long-term
clinical histories. We are actively engaged in several research and development efforts to develop
better instrumentation for less traumatic surgeries, improved component designs and bearing
surfaces to increase longevity of our devices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Spine Market</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Back and neck pain is one of the leading causes of healthcare expenditures in the United States,
with a direct cost of approximately $86&nbsp;billion annually for diagnosis, treatment and
rehabilitation, according to an article published in <I>The Journal of the American Medical
Association </I>(published February&nbsp;13, 2008). According to the Industry Annual Report, the U.S.
market for lumbar and cervical spine fusion, which is the focus of our spinal business, was
estimated to be over $3&nbsp;billion in 2006 and over $3.6&nbsp;billion in 2007, and is estimated to grow to
more than $4.2&nbsp;billion in 2008.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The spine consists of vertebrae, which are 29 separate bones connecting the skull to the pelvis.
The vertebrae are joined together by soft tissue structures that provide the core of the human
skeleton. Within the spinal column, the spinal cord, which is the body&#146;s central nerve pathway, is
protected by the bony parts of the vertebrae. Nerves contained in the spinal column exit through
the foramen openings to the rest of the body. Vertebrae are joined to each other in pairs which
are often referred to as motion segments. These motion segments move by means of three joints:
two facet joints and one spine disc. The facet joints provide stability and enable the spine to
bend and twist while the discs absorb pressures and shocks to the vertebrae.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions, deformities, trauma and
tumors. The largest market, and the focus of our spinal research and development business, is
degenerative conditions of the facet joints and disc space. These conditions can result in
instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column, causing back pain or
radiating pain in the arms or legs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The recommended treatments for spine disorders depend on the severity and duration of the disorder.
Initially, physicians will prescribe non-operative procedures, including bed rest, bracing,
medication, lifestyle modification, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care and steroid
injections. In most cases, non-surgical treatment options are effective; however, many patients do
not respond to non-operative treatments and require spine surgery to alleviate their symptoms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">It is estimated that in excess of one million patients undergo spine surgery each year in the
United States. The most common spine surgery procedures are: discectomy, which consists of the
removal of all or part of a damaged disc; laminectomy, the removal of all or part of a lamina, or
thin layer of bone, to relieve pinching of the nerve and narrowing of the spinal canal; and fusion,
where two or more adjoining vertebrae are fused together to provide stability. All three of these
procedures require access to the spine through either a traditional open approach or through
smaller, less invasive methods using various types of retractors or other percutaneous techniques.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe that the implant market for spine surgery procedures will continue to grow because of
the following market dynamics:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Demographics</I>. The population cohort most likely to experience back pain is likely to grow as a
result of our aging baby boomer population. The first baby boomers turned 62 in 2008, and over the
next two decades we will see a substantial increase in our aging population. We believe that this
generation of older people is less willing to compromise on reducing activity levels and is more
interested in treatments that will allow a more rapid return to activities with shorter periods of
disability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Increased Acceptance of Implants</I>. The implementation of implants for use in spine surgery has
become the standard of care over the past decade. In the last five years, there has been a
substantial and significant increase in the percentage of spinal fusion surgeries using implants.
According to Millennium Research Group, an estimated 85% or more of all spinal fusion procedures
involve an implant. The current generation of modern trained spine surgeons has accepted usage of
implants as the gold standard for achieving optimal results.

is interested in newer technologies, such as motion preservation, and novel minimally invasive
techniques which would potentially allow earlier intervention in the degenerative process of the
spine for many patients.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Generally, before we can market a new medical device, marketing clearance from the FDA must be
obtained through either a premarket notification under Section 510(k) or the approval of a
premarket approval, or PMA, application. The FDA typically grants a Section 510(k) clearance if
the applicant can establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device
(<I>i.e.</I>, a device with a similar design that has already received clearance). It generally takes
approximately three months from the date of a Section 510(k) submission to obtain clearance, but it
may take longer, particularly if a clinical trial is required. The FDA may find that a Section
510(k) clearance is not appropriate or that substantial equivalence has not been shown and, as a
result, will require a PMA application.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and
effectiveness of the device, typically including the results of human clinical trials, bench tests
and laboratory and animal studies. The PMA application also must contain a complete description of
the device and its components, and a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls
used to manufacture the device. In addition, the submission must include the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">proposed labeling and any training materials. The PMA application process can be expensive and
generally takes significantly longer than the Section 510(k) process. Additionally, the FDA may
never approve the PMA application. As part of the PMA application review process, the FDA
generally will inspect the manufacturer&#146;s facilities to ensure compliance with applicable quality
system regulatory requirements, which include quality control testing, control documentation and
other quality assurance procedures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If human clinical trials of a medical device are required and the device presents a significant
risk, the sponsor of the trial must file an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application
prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by data,
typically including the results of animal and/or laboratory testing. If the IDE application is
approved by the FDA and one or more institutional review boards, human clinical trials may begin at
a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the
FDA. If the device presents a nonsignificant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical
trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more institutional review boards without
separate approval from the FDA. Submission of an IDE does not give assurance that the FDA will
approve the IDE and, if it is approved, we cannot assure you that the FDA will determine that the
data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the
continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA
before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its
scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The
trial also must comply with the FDA&#146;s IDE regulations and informed consent must be obtained from
each subject.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If the FDA believes we are not in compliance with the law, it can institute proceedings to detain
or seize products, issue a market withdrawal, enjoin future violations and seek civil and criminal
penalties against us and our officers and employees. If we fail to comply with these regulatory
requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Thus far, all of our approved products have been cleared by the FDA through the Section 510(k)
premarket notification process. We have not needed to conduct any clinical trials to support some
of our regulatory approvals. Regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are
subject to change. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that these changes might have on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to granting approvals for our
products, the FDA has the authority to randomly inspect us for compliance with regulatory
requirements that apply to our operations. These requirements include labeling regulations,
manufacturing regulations, quality system regulations, regulations governing unapproved or
off-label uses and medical device regulations. Medical device regulations require a manufacturer
to report to the FDA serious adverse events or certain types of malfunctions involving its
products. The FDA inspects device and drug manufacturing facilities in the United States in order
to assure compliance with applicable quality system regulations. As discussed in the section below

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation,
and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in diverting management&#146;s
time and efforts, require us to pay damages and/or prevent us from marketing our existing or future
products. Patent litigation typically involves complex factual and legal questions whose outcome
is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against
us may require us to pay substantial damages. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our
intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and
time-consuming and could divert our management&#146;s attention. Our success will depend in part on our
not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. If
our products are found to infringe the patents of others, the development, manufacture and sale of
our products or potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. Also, our
competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are not restricted by other
companies&#146; patents, including ours. Due to the importance of our patents to our business, our
market share can decline if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A patent infringement suit brought against us or our partners may force us or our partners to halt
the development, manufacture or sale of products or potential products that are claimed to be
infringing, unless that party grants us or our partners rights to use its intellectual property.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The orthopedic and spinal device industry is highly competitive and dominated by a number of large
companies with substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Our largest
competitors in the orthopedic and spinal surgical device market are DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and
DePuy Spine, Inc. (divisions of Johnson &#038; Johnson Company), Zimmer, Inc. (a subsidiary of Zimmer
Holdings, Inc.), Stryker Howmedica Osteonics (a subsidiary of Stryker Corporation), Smith &#038; Nephew
plc, Biomet Orthopedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.), Medtronic Sofamor Danek, and Synthes
Inc.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Companies in the industry compete on the basis of product features and design, innovation, service,
the ability to maintain new product flow, relationships with key orthopedic surgeons and hospitals,
the strength of their distribution network and price. While price is a key factor in the
orthopedic market, other significant factors could negatively impact our results of operations and
financial condition, including: technological innovation, reimbursement rates, surgeon preference,
ease of use, clinical results and service provided by us and our representatives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our products are, and any potential products we commercialize will be, subject to intense
competition. Many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial,
technical and marketing resources than we do, and they may succeed in developing products that
would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. Many of these competitors also have
significantly greater operating history and reputations than we do in our respective fields. We
may not be able to compete successfully if we are unable to develop proprietary products that reach
the market in a timely manner, receive adequate reimbursement and are safer, less invasive and less
expensive than alternatives available for the same purpose. Because of the rapidly growing
orthopedic market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing
competing products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Regarding our spinal portfolio, we also face competition from a growing number of smaller companies
with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors. These
companies, who represent intense competition in specified markets, include Abbott Spine, Inc. (a
division of Abbott Laboratories, Inc.), Orthofix International N.V. (parent of Blackstone Medical,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, marketing and
sale of orthopedic implants and surgical instrumentation. We have implemented strict quality
control measures and currently maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are
typical in the industry for companies with a comparable size to ours. Our insurance premiums are
paid as a percentage of sales. We plan to evaluate our levels of product liability insurance
annually, as well as the amount of retention carried compared to other comparable companies in the
industry. Due to the volatility of the insurance marketplace, the value of the product liability
insurance products delivered and the small number of providers of these products, there can be no
guarantees as to whether we will be able to secure coverage in the future at a reasonable cost.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Third-Party Reimbursement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party
payors (such as governmental programs, for example, Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans
and managed care programs), both in terms of the sales volumes and prices of our products.
Healthcare providers, such as hospitals that purchase medical devices for treating their patients,
generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with
the procedures performed with these devices. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if
they feel that a device is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or was used for an
unapproved indication. As such, surgeons are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive
reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in the surgical procedures. We also
believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and
internationally. If we sell our products internationally, market acceptance may depend, in part,
upon the availability of reimbursement within the prevailing healthcare payment systems.
Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by
country, and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect
the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development and limit our
ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and
services. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors carefully review, and increasingly
challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Also, greater numbers of
insured individuals are receiving (and will continue to receive over the next decade) their medical
care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of

a capitated basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their
patients by paying them a predetermined payment per member per month.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a
manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies
coverage for those procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical
products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the
healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure you that
third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation,
regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand
for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. We also cannot
assure you that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that
reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors&#146; reimbursement
policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our relationship with surgeons, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny
under various state and federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often
referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. The federal anti-kickback laws
prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded
health care programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain
medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex
and subject to evolving interpretations, and even minor, inadvertent violations potentially can
give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Certain states in which we market our
products have similar anti-kickback, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, imposing
substantial penalties for violations. Any violations of these laws could result in a material
adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the healthcare fraud and
abuse laws will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely
affects our business activities or relationships with surgeons, hospitals and marketers of our
products. In addition, possible sanctions for violating these anti-kickback laws include monetary
fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and forfeiture
of amounts collected in violation of these prohibitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We must comply with a variety of other laws, such as laws prohibiting false claims for
reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid, which also can be triggered by violations of federal
anti-kickback laws; Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which protects
the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information; and the Federal Trade Commission
Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections. In certain cases, federal
and state authorities pursue actions for false claims on the basis that manufacturers and
distributors are promoting unapproved or off-label uses of their products.

level of debt and equity and the resultant cash to implement our business plan. We may need to
raise additional funds, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we
raise capital by issuing equity or debt securities, our existing shareholders may experience
dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior
to those of our existing shareholders. Further, if we raise additional funds through
collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish rights to
our potential products or proprietary technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not
favorable to us. If we are unable to raise needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may not be
able to develop new products, enhance our existing products, execute our business plan, take

may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to expand our operations and reach

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms
initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a
consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This has resulted in greater
pricing and other competitive pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important
market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single
accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some hospital customers. We expect that
market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures
will continue to change the national and worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further
business consolidations and alliances among customers and competitors. This consolidation may
reduce competition, exert downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, third-party payors in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare
costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, along with closer scrutiny of healthcare
expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">singular product focus, as well as companies owned partially by surgeons, who may have greater
access than we do to the surgeons who may use our products. As a result of this intensified
competition, we believe there will be increasing pressure to reduce pricing of our medical devices.
If we are unable to price our products appropriately due to these competitive pressures or for
other reasons, our profit margins will shrink and our ability to invest in and grow our business
and achieve profitability will decrease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from
third-party payors (such as governmental programs, for example, Medicare and Medicaid, private
insurance plans and managed care programs), both in terms of the sales volumes and prices of our
products. Healthcare providers, such as hospitals that purchase medical devices for treating their
patients, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees
associated with the procedures performed with these devices. These third-party payors may deny
reimbursement if they feel that a device is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or was
used for an unapproved indication. As such, surgeons are unlikely to use our products if they do
not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in the surgical
procedures. We also believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions
both in the U.S. and international markets. If we sell our products internationally, market
acceptance may depend, in part, upon the availability of reimbursement within the prevailing
healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets
vary significantly by country, and include both government sponsored healthcare and private
insurance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect
the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development and limit our
ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and
services. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors carefully review, and increasingly
challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Also, greater numbers of
insured individuals are receiving (and will continue to receive over the next decade) their medical
care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services
that a member will receive. Many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated
basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by
paying them a predetermined payment per member per month.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a
manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies
coverage for those procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical
products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the
healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure you that
third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation,
regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand
for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. We also cannot
assure you that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The medical device market is highly competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly
affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We
expect to encounter intense competition across our product lines and in each market in which our
products are sold from various medical device companies, many of which are likely to have greater
financial and marketing resources than us. Primary competitors are Zimmer, J&#038;J/DePuy Orthopaedics,
Stryker and Biomet in the hips and knees market, and Medtronic/Sofamor Danek, J&#038;J/DePuy Spine and
Synthes in the spine market. In addition, we will face competition from a wide range of companies
that sell a single or a limited number of competitive products or which participate only in a
specific market segment, as well as from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical
companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using
our products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Additionally, the medical device market is characterized by extensive research and development, and
rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes
or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may
negatively impact our revenues. We will be required to devote continued efforts and financial
resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our
technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled
development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain
required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our

key surgeons and hospitals in the field of orthopedic knee, hip and spinal surgery. Many of these
key surgeons and hospitals already have long-standing relationships with large, better-known
companies that dominate the medical devices industry through collaborative research programs and
other relationships. Because of these existing relationships, some of which may be contractually
enforced, surgeons and hospitals may be reluctant to adopt our products, particularly if our
products compete with or have the potential to compete with products supported through their own
collaborative research programs or by these existing relationships. Even if these surgeons and
hospitals purchase our products, they may be unwilling to enter into collaborative relationships

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the
Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies.
The FDA and other federal, state and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things,
the development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing clearance and approval, promotion and
sale of medical devices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the
device has received clearance under Section&nbsp;510(k), or is the subject of an approved premarket
approval application, or PMA. The FDA will approve marketing a medical device through the Section
510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other
Section&nbsp;510(k)-cleared products. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the
Section 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data,
including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling
data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its
intended use. To date, all of our products, unless exempt, have been cleared through the Section
510(k) process. We have no experience in obtaining premarket approval.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Compliance with complex regulations is, and will continue to be, time-consuming, burdensome and
expensive. Failure to comply with these regulations could jeopardize our ability to manufacture
and sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as warning letters, fines,
injunctions, civil penalties, termination of distribution, seizures of products, total or partial
suspension of production, refusal of the FDA or other regulatory agencies to grant future
clearances or approvals, or withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals. These
enforcement actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue
and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the most egregious cases, we could face criminal sanctions, closure of the manufacturing
facilities in which our products are manufactured, and prohibitions on the sales of our products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have
become increasingly vigilant, and if we engage in sales of our products in foreign countries, these
sales would be subject to rigorous foreign regulations. In these circumstances, we would rely
heavily on our foreign independent sales agencies to comply with the varying regulations,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign
countries. We currently do not sell any of our products internationally.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Federal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Legislation may be drafted from time to time and introduced in Congress that could significantly
change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a
medical device in the United States. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance often are revised
or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our ability
to commercialize our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be
enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of these
changes, if any, may be. For example, on September&nbsp;27, 2007, Congress enacted, and the President
signed into law, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. This new legislation
grants significant new powers to the FDA and imposes new obligations and requirements on both the
FDA and FDA-regulated industries, including the medical device industry. In particular, this law
requires, among other things, that the FDA propose, and ultimately implement, regulations that will
require manufacturers to label medical devices with unique identifiers unless a waiver is received
from the FDA. In addition, it reauthorizes the FDA to collect medical device user fees and amends
the existing user fee program by, among other things, reducing device application fees and imposing
new fees, including a new annual establishment registration fee. Also, the new law authorizes the
FDA to establish a unique medical device identification system and expands the federal government&#146;s
clinical trial registry and results databank to include, among other things, information on medical
device clinical trials. While these new requirements undoubtedly will have a significant effect on
the medical device industry, we cannot yet predict the extent of that effect on our company. As
regulations, guidance and interpretations are issued by the FDA relating to the new legislation,
its impact on the industry, as well as our business, will become clearer. Compliance with those
regulations could require us to take additional steps, and incur additional costs, in manufacturing
and labeling products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>We have not yet collected long-term clinical data to support the safety of our products, and our
products may, therefore, prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We obtained clearance to offer all of our products that require FDA clearance or approval through
the Section 510(k) clearance process, which is less rigorous than the PMA process and requires less
supporting clinical data. As a result of using this expedited process, we currently lack the
breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety of our products and the benefits
they offer that might have been generated using the PMA process. Because of the lack of this
in-depth data, surgeons may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that
our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product
liability risks. Further, future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that
treatment with our products does not improve outcomes. These results would reduce demand for our
products, thereby preventing us from becoming profitable. If future results and experience
indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative
effects, we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation.
The medical device market has been particularly prone to costly product liability litigation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Any modification to a Section&nbsp;510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or
efficacy, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new Section
510(k) clearance or, possibly, premarket approval. Under FDA regulations, every manufacturer must
make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer&#146;s decision.
The FDA may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are
necessary. If the FDA requires us to seek Section 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any
modification to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing, or to recall,
the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval. This may expose us to significant
regulatory fines or penalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that
our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or FDA requirement that we seek additional
approvals or clearances could result in delays, fines, costs associated with modifying a product,
loss of revenue, harm to our reputation and loss of customers and potential operating restrictions
imposed by the FDA. Any product liability claim or recall would divert managerial and financial
resources and could harm our reputation with customers. We cannot assure you that we will not have
product liability claims or recalls in the future, or that these claims or recalls would not have a
material adverse effect on our business.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We and some of our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA&#146;s Quality System
Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production,
control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our
products. In addition, we and our manufacturers will be subject to the regulations of foreign
jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process if we market our products overseas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities.
If our facilities or those of our manufacturers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in
response to an adverse QSR inspection, the FDA could take enforcement action, including any of the
following sanctions:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For all the foregoing reasons, it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for our products with
any degree of certainty. In addition, we will be increasing our operating expenses as we build our

market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in
our products. We rely significantly on patent protection, as well as a combination of trade
secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing
opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We also expect to
pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the United States and abroad for
patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents and
patent applications to the extent they become known to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid
infringing third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of
others.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending in spine, hip and knee
reconstructive surgery. Although we have filed these patent applications, we cannot assure you
that any patents may issue or that, if they issue, these patents will adequately protect our rights
or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may deny or require significant narrowing of claims
in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent
applications, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a
form that is advantageous to us. We also could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the
USPTO. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions
and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in any patents that may issue. Any U.S. and foreign
patents that may be issued in the future could subsequently be successfully challenged by others
and invalidated or rendered unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from
marketing and selling related products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be
time-consuming and expensive. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop
products that provide outcomes that are comparable to our products. Although we have entered into
confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of our
employees, consultants and advisors as one of the ways we seek to protect our intellectual property
and other proprietary technology, these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide
meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of
unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. Furthermore, the laws of some
foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">laws of the United States, if at all. Since most of our pending patent applications are for the
United States only, we lack a corresponding scope of patent protection in other countries. Thus,
we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products in other countries that are similar
to some of our products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Changes to intellectual property laws may negatively impact our ability to protect our intellectual
property.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There are numerous proposed changes to the patent laws and rules of the USPTO, which, if enacted,
may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual
property rights. For example, proposed changes to the patent rules of the USPTO were scheduled to
take effect on November&nbsp;1, 2007, which would have limited significantly the right to pursue
continuation applications. On October&nbsp;31, 2007, a temporary injunction was granted in a lawsuit
against the USPTO which served to stay the application of the proposed rules. On April&nbsp;1, 2008,
the court issued its ruling that the proposed patent rules were void, thus making the injunction
permanent. If the ruling is successfully appealed, the proposed rules may take effect and may
adversely impact our ability to prevent others from designing around our existing patents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">intellectual
property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product
development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation to defend or create
market advantage is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts frequently
overturn lower court patent decisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across
product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties.
In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related
proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of medical devices. These forces
frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and
potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is
typically sought, remedies and restitution generally are not determined until the conclusion of the
proceedings and are frequently modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases
are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases
in other geographies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain product categories, including pedicle screws, have been subject to significant patent
litigation in recent years. Since we sell orthopedic and spinal devices, such as pedicle screws,
knee replacement devices, and cervical plates, and we recently introduced our Accin pedicle screw
system, any related litigation could harm our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or
know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type
could be costly and time-consuming, and we cannot assure you that any lawsuit will be successful.
In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to
defend our patents against a challenge.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, we intend to protect our proprietary technology, in part, through proprietary information
and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. These agreements with some
of our employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals
to assign to the employer, without additional consideration, inventions conceived or reduced to
practice by them while employed or retained by the employer, subject to customary exceptions. If
any of our employees, consultants or others breach these agreements, or if these agreements are
found to be unenforceable, competitors may learn of our trade secrets and proprietary information.

party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property. In
those cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in
order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any
licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or
at all, and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us. Even if we,
any strategic partners or licensees were able to obtain rights to the third party&#146;s intellectual
property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same
intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential

medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We could in the
future be subject to claims that these employees and consultants, or we, have inadvertently or
otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former
employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail to defend
against these claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using
technologies or features that are essential to our products and processes, if these technologies or
features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary
information of the former employers. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property
rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or
prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential products, which could severely harm our

substantial costs and be a distraction to management.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Many jurisdictions, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under
which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, most
countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government
contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be
unable to enjoin infringement, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory
licensing of life-saving products also is becoming increasingly popular in
developing countries, either through direct legislation or international initiatives. These
compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our products or product candidates, which
may limit our potential revenue opportunities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Reconstructive and spine surgery involves a high risk of serious complications, including bleeding,
nerve injury, paralysis and even death. As a result, we are exposed to potential product liability
claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices for surgery
procedures. Many of these medical devices are designed to be implanted in the human body for long
periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury
to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell,
including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of
product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product
liability claims, a recall of one or more products or a safety alert relating to one or more

a class.

Accelerated Innovation) and as a result of the Merger, we assumed the responsibility for any
litigation or claims related to Accin&#146;s business, including product liability claims relating to
products previously sold by Accin. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits,
is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits often seek recovery of very large
or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The
magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial
periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase
of our insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future. In addition, if our
product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may have to pay the
excess out of our cash reserves, which may harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient
results and experience indicate that our products or any component cause tissue damage, motor
impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. Finally, even a
meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead
to significant legal fees and result in diverting management&#146;s attention from managing our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The stock market in general and the stocks of medical device companies in particular have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies involved. If these fluctuations
occur in the future, the market price of our shares could fall regardless of our operating
performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular
company&#146;s securities, securities class action litigation has been brought against that company. If
the market price or volume of our shares suffers extreme fluctuations, then it may become involved
in this type of litigation which would be expensive and divert management&#146;s attention and resources
from managing the business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At this time, no securities analyst provides research coverage of our common stock. Further,
securities analysts may never provide this coverage in the future. Rules mandated by the Sarbanes
Oxley Act of 2002 and other restrictions led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are
reviewed and compensated. In particular, many investment banking firms are required to contract
with independent financial analysts for their stock research. It may remain difficult for a
company with a smaller market capitalization such as ours to attract independent financial analysts
that will cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack
of research coverage may adversely affect our actual and potential market price and trading volume.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that
industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more analysts elect to cover
our company and then downgrade the stock, the stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or
more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which
in turn could cause our stock price to decline. This could have a negative effect on the market
price of our shares.

shell company and, as a result of the Merger, acquired an operating business through a reverse
merger. Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage for us. In addition,
because of past abuses and fraud concerns stemming primarily from a lack of public information
about new public businesses, there are many people in the securities industry and
business in general who view reverse merger transactions with public shell companies with

tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide
purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the Securities

level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market. A broker also must give a
purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and
salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable
investment for the purchaser, and obtain the purchaser&#146;s written agreement to the purchase. In
addition, broker-dealers must provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with that
broker-dealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny
stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules, the investor

our common stock. Because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny stock, there is less

to exert substantial influence over the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of
issues requiring approval by our shareholders. This concentration of ownership also may have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The deficiency identified in the first bullet above created several adjustments to our 2007
consolidated financial statements, which were not detected initially by management. The
adjustments were related to the timing of revenue recognition, the calculation of work in process
and the value of fixed assets. The remaining deficiencies did not result in audit adjustments to
our 2007 consolidated financial statements. However, any of these control deficiencies could
result in a material misstatement of significant accounts or disclosures that would result in a
material misstatement to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be
prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined that each of these control
deficiencies constitutes a material weakness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have begun to, or are intending to, take various measures to remediate our material weaknesses.
In February&nbsp;2008, we hired a Chief Financial Officer and subsequently engaged finance and
accounting consultants to ensure that there are sufficient resources with the technical abilities
to prepare our financial statements and disclosures in accordance with GAAP. We have begun to
assess various inventory tracking software, as well as an improved general ledger accounting system
for all business units, which will establish mitigating controls to compensate for risks due to
lack of segregation of duties. In addition, we are taking steps to unify the financial reporting
of our consolidated subsidiaries, and we are in the initial planning phase of upgrading, where
possible, certain of our information technology systems impacting financial reporting. In
connection with the above, we are currently seeking information technology resources that are
adequately qualified to ensure that the information technology general computing controls are
effective over our systems impacting financial reporting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Through these steps, we believe we are addressing the deficiencies that affected our internal
control over financial reporting. However, the effectiveness of any system of internal controls is
subject to inherent limitations and we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all errors. Also, management may not be able to implement
necessary improvements to internal control over financial reporting in an efficient and timely
manner and may discover additional deficiencies and weaknesses in existing systems and controls,
especially if the systems and controls are tested by an increased rate of growth or the impact of
acquisitions. In addition, upgrades or enhancements to computer systems could cause internal
control weaknesses. Because the remedial actions require hiring additional personnel, upgrading
our information technology systems and relying extensively on manual review and approval, the
successful operation of these controls for at least several quarters may be required before
management may be able to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We intend to continue to evaluate and strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting
systems. These efforts require significant time and resources. If we are unable to establish
adequate internal controls over financial reporting systems, we may encounter difficulties in the
audit or review of our financial statements by our independent public accountants, which in turn
may have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting obligations imposed
upon us by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

public accounting firm is unable to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls, is unable to
deliver a report at all or can deliver only a qualified report, we could be subject to regulatory

costs in 2008 and beyond and to make certain activities more time-consuming and costly than if we
were not an operating public company. As an operating public company, we also expect that these
new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and
officer liability insurance in the future, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits
and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a
result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our

public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, new regulations promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and rules promulgated by the American Stock Exchange, the other national
securities exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market. These new or changed laws, regulations and
standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity,
and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance
matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to
continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management
time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members,
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal
liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty
attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our
business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from
the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we could be subject to liability under
applicable laws or our reputation may be harmed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our
financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in
greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cardo Medical, LLC, an orthopedic medical device company specializing in designing, developing and
marketing reconstructive joint devices and spinal surgical devices, was formed as a California
limited liability company in April&nbsp;2007. Reconstructive joint devices are used to replace knee,
hip and other joints that have deteriorated through disease or injury. Spinal surgical devices
involve products to stabilize the spine for fusion and reconstructive procedures. Within these
areas, we intend to focus on the higher-growth sectors of the orthopedic industry, such as advanced
minimally invasive instrumentation and bone conserving high-performance implants. We are focused
on developing surgical techniques that bridge the gap between soft tissue-driven sports medicine
techniques and classical reconstructive surgical procedures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We initiated sales of our Align 360 unicompartmental knee device in 2007. We have received Section
510(k) approval from the Food and Drug Administration for our uniquely instrumented patello-femoral
arthroplasty as well as for our total hip replacement system and our bipolar and

system and our cervical plate and screw systems.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since its inception in July&nbsp;2005, Cervical Xpand has generated significant losses in connection
with the research and development of its technology and has accumulated a deficit equal to
$259,528. Since its inception in May&nbsp;2006, Uni-Knee has generated significant losses in connection
with the research and development of its technology and has accumulated a deficit equal to
$230,573. Since its inception in June&nbsp;2007, Accelerated has accumulated a deficit of $943,325 and
Cardo has accumulated a deficit of $1,663,161 in connection with research and development activities.
The total accumulated deficit at June 30, 2008 was approximately $3.0&nbsp;million. We expect to continue
to generate losses in connection with the research and development activities relating to our
technology and products. As a result, we believe that our operating losses are likely to be
substantial over the next several years. These losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to
quarter and are expected to increase as we expand our research and development programs. We may
need to obtain additional funds to finish testing our products and to further develop our research
and development programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which
prevent us from concluding that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. See the risk
factor regarding internal controls under the caption &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in Item&nbsp;1A of these Form&nbsp;10
disclosures, which discusses these weaknesses and describes our remediation efforts.

from which Cardo acquired its medical device business, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007,
assuming they were combined at the beginning of 2007, compared to the results of operations of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 increased by $790,568 from the previous year.
Accin, the company from which Cardo acquired its medical device business, launched and commenced
sales of its first product in December&nbsp;2006, which was a high-performance, unicompartmental knee
replacement. Accin had one sale in the amount of $9,547 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.
During 2007, sales increased as more doctors, the majority of whom are also members of Cardo, started using Cardo&#146;s products in expanding geographic
areas. Sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 amounted to $800,115.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Costs of Sales</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Costs of sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 increased by $91,324 from the previous year.
Costs of sales in fiscal 2006 were only $2,107 as a result of lower sales volume. Our gross profit
percentage for 2007 was 88.3%, which represented an increase from 77.9% in 2006. This profit
percentage increase resulted from higher average sales prices and lower production costs in 2007.
We incur greater production costs the initial time that a product is developed due to additional
expenses for setup costs. Over time, the average cost per item decreases, which results
in a higher gross profit percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Research and development expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 decreased by $223,353, or
46.6%, from 2006. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to our
incurring less prototype expenses during 2007. As Accin&#146;s sales were launched in late 2006, Accin
spent more on development costs during fiscal 2006 than in fiscal 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 increased by
$775,629, or 530.2%, as compared to 2006. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, we entered into
a developmental and marketing agreement with a third-party contractor relating to our
unicompartmental knee replacement product. During 2006, we received $800,000 relating to this
agreement, which was recorded as a reduction of our selling, general and administrative expenses.
In addition, during 2007, our incentive compensation and sales commission expenses increased by
approximately $114,000, and our distribution expenses increased by approximately $86,000 as a
result of the increase in sales during the year. We also incurred increased depreciation expense
in 2007 of approximately $49,000 due to increased capital expenditures in 2007 for instrumentation
and other equipment necessary to support our growth. These increases in selling, general and
administrative expenses in 2007 were partially offset by higher

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net sales for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 increased by $323,140, or 163.0%, as compared to
the same period in 2007. Accin, the company from which Cardo acquired its medical device business,
launched and commenced sales of its first product in December&nbsp;2006, which was a high-performance,
unicompartmental knee replacement product. Sales of this product increased throughout 2007 and
into 2008. As a result, our sales for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 were higher than in the
same period in 2007. In addition, during 2008, we began sales of our reconstructive hip and spine
products, which sales amounted to approximately $61,000 during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Costs of sales for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 increased by $41,855, or 134.9%, as compared
to the same period in 2007 due to our sales escalating during 2007 and 2008. Our
costs of sales in 2008 included approximately $13,000 attributable to sales of our hip and spine
products, which commenced during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008. Our gross profit

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">percentage
for 2008 was 86.0%, representing an increase from 84.3% in 2007. This increase was primarily a
result of lower per unit production costs during 2008. We incur greater production costs the first
time that a product is developed as a result of additional expenses
for setup costs.
Over time, the average cost decreases, which results in a higher gross profit percentage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Research and development expenses for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 increased by $1,047,008,
or 2,546.3%, from the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to $937,500 of
in-process research and development expenses acquired in connection with the purchase of the
non-controlling interest in Accelerated Innovation, LLC in June&nbsp;2008. The acquired in-process
research and development, which is related to a total knee system under development, is expected to
be completed in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we increased prototype expenses in 2008
for production of our hip replacement prototypes. There were no expenditures for these items in
2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 increased by
$1,044,968, or 253.2%, as compared to the same period in 2007. During 2008, we incurred
approximately $821,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses, that we did not incur
during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007. These expenses related primarily to legal and
accounting fees associated with the Merger, contract labor and payroll expenses, as well as rent
and office related expenses. In addition, during 2008, our incentive compensation and sales
commission expenses increased by approximately $96,000 and our distribution expenses increased by
approximately $15,000 as a result of the increase in sales during the period. We also incurred $35,156 of expenses in 2008 relating to share-based compensation pursuant to an
employment offer letter presented to Derrick Romine in
February&nbsp;2008. We also incurred
increased depreciation expense in 2008 of approximately $62,000 as a result of increased capital
expenditures during the latter part of 2007 and 2008 for instrumentation and other equipment
necessary to support our growth. We also had an increase in amortization expense of approximately
$25,000 for license fees paid in late 2007 and 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net interest expense for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 amounted to $41,662, which consisted of
interest expense of $48,329 relating to a note payable of $1.2&nbsp;million issued in February&nbsp;2008,
offset by interest income of $6,667. During the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, our interest
income amounted to $28,772. We had no interest expense in 2007, as we had no outstanding debt.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Over the next 12&nbsp;months, we intend to use our capital to accelerate our research and product
development, to add internal sales and financing personnel, to increase in-house vendor-related
operations, and for working capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2007, we raised an aggregate of $5.0&nbsp;million in capital contributions as the initial
capitalization in connection with the formation of Cardo. Thereafter, also in May&nbsp;2007, Accin
contributed substantially all of its business, properties and assets, including its majority
interests in Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee, to Accelerated, and we contributed $3.75&nbsp;million to
Accelerated, which amount was distributed to Accin. This resulted in Cardo owing a 37.5% ownership
interest in Accelerated, and Accin owning a 62.5% ownership interest with an option to acquire the
ownership interest from Accin for a purchase price of $6.25&nbsp;million. After the capital
contribution to Accelerated, Cardo had remaining cash of approximately $1.25&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2008, Cardo borrowed $1.2&nbsp;million from the trustee of a member of Cardo to partially
finance the acquisition of the minority interests of Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee for an aggregate
purchase price of $3,486,690.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;19, 2008, on or about the signing of the Merger Agreement, Frost Gamma Investments
Trust and other investors invested $12.975&nbsp;million in Cardo in exchange for units of Cardo&#146;s
membership interests. Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Opko Health, Inc.
(formerly known as eXegenics Inc.), is the trustee and beneficiary of Frost Gamma Investments
Trust. Cardo used approximately $9.7&nbsp;million of the proceeds from these investments to close on
the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests of three partially owned subsidiaries of Cardo
(Accelerated Innovation, LLC, Cervical Xpand, LLC and Uni-Knee, LLC), to repay an existing member
loan (in the amount of $1.2&nbsp;million) and for transaction expenses, and expects to use the remaining
funds to accelerate its research and product development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, as of the closing of the Merger, CKST had cash and cash equivalents in the approximate
amount of $2.5&nbsp;million held in money market accounts and certificates of deposit, which is now
available for use in our business due to the Merger. In total, we currently have $4.7&nbsp;million in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We historically have used significant amounts of cash in our operating activities. We have funded
our working capital requirements from a combination of cash provided by member contributions, an
arrangement with a third-party contractor as described above to finance our activities related to a
certain product and the gross profit from sales of our products. If we are unable to obtain
additional equity financing before our sales increase to the point that they can sustain our
operations, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We anticipate spending significant amounts of cash on expanding our research and development, sales
and marketing efforts, and product commercialization. We expect that general and administrative
expenses also will increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff, add infrastructure
and incur additional costs related to being an operating public company in the United States,
including the costs of directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance, investor relations programs and
increased professional fees. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors,
including the continued progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing
and outcome of obtaining regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing,
prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property
rights, acquiring licenses to new products, the status of competitive products, the availability of
financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. We believe that the
proceeds from our recent transactions, together with our future sales, existing cash and cash
equivalent balances and interest we earn on these balances, and the cash and cash equivalents held
by CKST as of the closing of the Merger, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash
requirements for at least the next 12&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our primary goal as it relates to liquidity and capital resources is to attain the appropriate
level of debt and equity and the resultant cash to implement our business plan. We may need to
raise additional funds, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we
raise capital by issuing equity or debt securities, our existing shareholders may experience
dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior
to those of our existing shareholders. Further, if we raise additional funds through
collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish rights to
our potential products or proprietary technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not
favorable to us. If we are unable to raise needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may not be
able to develop new products, enhance our existing products, execute our business plan, take
advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer
requirements. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

respectively. This debt was due to the trustee of a member of Cardo. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, we were
current on all of our debt obligations. The $1.2&nbsp;million loan was repaid in full on July&nbsp;3, 2008,

with these two employees with compensation packages that are competitive with those paid for

receipt of FDA approval of the related products and expect the delivery of this inventory to take
place in the fourth quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2008, we presented an employment offer letter to Derrick Romine, the Chief Financial
Officer of Cardo, pursuant to which he would have been granted, upon completion of a private
placement transaction contemplated by Cardo at that time, units of membership interests in Cardo
equal to 1.25% of all then-outstanding membership interests in Cardo. This grant would be made
pursuant to terms and conditions set forth in a Restricted Unit Agreement to be entered into by
Cardo and Mr.&nbsp;Romine upon the grant of the units, which Cardo and Mr.&nbsp;Romine never entered into.
Pursuant to the terms of the offer letter, the units would have been subject to vesting in five
equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of Mr.&nbsp;Romine&#146;s start date with
Cardo, subject to acceleration on a &#147;change in control&#148; event that would have been defined in the
Restricted Unit Agreement, and subject to forfeiture of any unvested units and a right of
repurchase in favor of Cardo of any vested units upon any termination of his employment. At June
18, 2008, the closing date of the Merger, we had a contingent obligation to grant these units to
Mr.&nbsp;Romine. The estimated fair value of these units is $562,500 as of June&nbsp;30, 2008. On September
5, 2008, Mr.&nbsp;Romine executed a new offer letter in which he acknowledged that the offer letter
presented to him in February&nbsp;2008 is void and of no effect and does not create any rights or
obligations for him or Cardo. As such, the contingent liability based on the February offer letter
no longer exists.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of Accelerated&#146;s Limited Liability Company Agreement, Cardo was granted an option
to purchase the 62.5% interest in Accelerated held by Accin for a purchase price of $6.25&nbsp;million.
Following the exercise of that option in June&nbsp;2008, Cardo acquired all of the interests in
Accelerated held by Accin, and Accelerated became Cardo&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to that, in February&nbsp;2008, Cardo entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreements with
the holders of the minority membership interests in Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee. Cervical Xpand
and Uni-Knee were formed as New Jersey limited liability companies on July&nbsp;12, 2005 and May&nbsp;10,
2006, respectively, for the purpose of conducting research and development activities. Prior to
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Interest Purchase Agreements,
Accelerated, as the assignee of Accin&#146;s assets, owned 52.083% of the membership interests in
Cervical Xpand and 51.21% of the membership interests in Uni-Knee, and the minority holders held
the remaining outstanding interests. Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Membership Interest Purchase Agreements, Cardo acquired the outstanding membership interests from
the minority holders for an aggregate purchase price of $1,437,510 for the Cervical Xpand interests
and $2,049,180 for the Uni-Knee interests. As a result, Cardo owns all of the interests in
Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee directly and indirectly through our ownership of Accelerated.

Activities&#151;an amendment of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;133.&#148; This standard requires companies to provide
enhanced disclosures about (a)&nbsp;how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b)&nbsp;how
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its
related interpretations, and (c)&nbsp;how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entity&#146;s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November&nbsp;15,
2008, with early application encouraged. We have adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;161, but since
we do not have any derivative instruments or hedging activities, the adoption did not have any

developing an estimate of expected term of &#147;plain vanilla&#148; share options in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. In
particular, the staff indicated in SAB 107 that it will accept a company&#146;s election to use the
simplified method, regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more
refined estimates of expected term. At the time SAB 107 was issued, the staff believed that more
detailed external information about employee exercise behavior (<I>e.g.</I>, employee exercise patterns by
industry and/or other categories of companies) would, over time, become readily available to
companies. Therefore, the staff stated in SAB 107 that it would not expect a company to use the
simplified method for share option grants after December&nbsp;31, 2007. The staff understands that the
detailed information about employee exercise behavior may not be widely available by December&nbsp;31,
2007. Accordingly, the staff will continue to accept, under

Statements&#151;an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51.&#148; This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Before this statement was issued, limited guidance existed for reporting
noncontrolling interests. As a result, considerable diversity in practice existed. So-called
minority interests were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities
or in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. This statement improves comparability
by eliminating that diversity. This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008 (that is, January&nbsp;1, 2009, for
entities with calendar year-ends). Earlier adoption is prohibited. The effective date of this
statement is the same as that of the related Statement 141 (revised 2007). We will adopt this

requirements in Statement 141. This statement establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer: (a)&nbsp;recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquire; (b)&nbsp;recognizes
and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase;
and (c)&nbsp;determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning
of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008. An entity may not
apply it before that date. The effective date of this statement is the same as that of the related
FASB Statement No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; We will

measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This option is available
to all entities. Most of the provisions in SFAS No.&nbsp;159 are elective; however, an amendment to
SFAS No.&nbsp;115, &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities&#148; applies to all
entities with available for sale or trading securities. Some requirements apply differently to
entities that do not report net income. SFAS No.&nbsp;159 is effective as of the beginning of an

provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled
for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term &#147;effectively
settled&#148; replaces the term &#147;ultimately settled&#148; when used to describe recognition, and the terms
&#147;settlement&#148; or &#147;settled&#148; replace the terms &#147;ultimate settlement&#148; or &#147;ultimately settled&#148; when used
to describe measurement of a tax position under FIN 48. FSP FIN 48-1 clarifies that a tax position
can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without
being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would
recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely
than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of
limitations remains open. As Cardo is a tax flow-through entity, and is not an income tax payer,
the adoption of FSP FIN 48-1 did not have an impact on the accompanying financial statements.

fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting
pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this statement
does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of
this statement will change current practice. This statement is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued
financial statements for that fiscal year, including financial statements for an interim period

uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements in accordance with
SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#148; This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model
for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements
uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return, including a decision

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 included in this filing have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP and contemplate the continuance of our company as a going concern. As a
result of the historic losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations and current
liabilities exceeding current assets, there was substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as
a going concern. However, as a result of the recent transactions discussed above, we have
available to us an approximate aggregate of $4.7&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents, which we
expect will be sufficient for us to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12
months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If additional funds are required, management intends to use borrowings and securities sales to
mitigate the effects of our use of that cash. However, we cannot assure you that debt or equity
financing, if and when required, will be available. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our existence.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its
entirety by, the financial statements and the notes thereto included with this Current Report on
Form 8-K, our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, and our
subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-QSB filed for the fiscal quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2007,
December&nbsp;31, 2007 and March&nbsp;31, 2008. As used in this &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations of CKST,&#148; the term &#147;CKST&#148; refers to the business of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CKST ceased all operations relating to its historical ADR business in January&nbsp;2005 as a result of
the sale of that business. Therefore, before the consummation of the Merger, CKST was a shell
company that had no operations or revenues and had assets consisting only of cash, cash equivalents
and nominal other assets. CKST&#146;s expenses consisted of the amounts required to maintain its status
as a reporting public company, the costs associated with the sale of its stock in September&nbsp;2007
and March&nbsp;2008, and the costs incurred in connection with the Merger. Professional fees
constituted CKST&#146;s primary expense. CKST&#146;s expenses were greater than its interest income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At June&nbsp;30, 2008, CKST had cash and cash equivalents of $2,696,946 and no liabilities. CKST had an
accumulated deficit of $10,308,164 at June&nbsp;30, 2008. CKST&#146;s net loss for the fiscal year ended
June&nbsp;30, 2008 was $259,107. Expenses in fiscal 2008 were higher than in the two previous years
principally because of the stock sales and the resulting changes of control in September&nbsp;2007 and
March&nbsp;2008.

California 90048. The rent for this office is approximately $2,200 per month. The lease for this

basis. We expect to move our corporate office to a larger space within the next six months.

California, which was provided by Andrew A. Brooks, M.D. There is no written lease agreement and,
as the amount of rent was not deemed material, prior to the closing of the Merger, Dr.&nbsp;Brooks did
not charge rent for using this office. The monthly lease payment for this office is approximately
$2,300, which was paid by Dr.&nbsp;Brooks prior to the closing of the Merger. Upon closing of the
Merger, the lease for this space is being transferred to us, and we will reimburse Dr.&nbsp;Brooks for
our use of this space since February&nbsp;2008.

executives so that we can execute our business plans and create value for our shareholders. We
intend to determine the levels and types of compensation to reward individual contribution and the
overall financial performance of our company. In that regard, we intend to tie annual and
long-term cash and stock incentives to achievement of specified performance objectives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To achieve these goals, we plan to form a compensation committee to recommend executive
compensation packages to our Board of Directors. Generally, these packages will be based on a mix
of salary, discretionary bonus and equity awards, a substantial portion of which will be tied to
the achievement of our corporate goals.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the past, Cardo has conducted periodic reviews of the aggregate level of its executive
compensation and other benefits given to executives. Cardo has based these reviews on its survey
of peer companies in the medical device industry of a similar size and stage of development as
ours. In addition, Cardo has reviewed other publicly available information within and outside its
industry and also within the geographic areas in which it has had operations. Cardo has not
retained a compensation consultant to review its policies and procedures with respect to executive
compensation. However, we may retain the services of third-party executive compensation
specialists from time to time in connection with establishing cash and equity compensation and
related policies.

consist of one or more of the following elements:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Base Salary</I></B>. Base salaries for our executives are established based on the scope of their
responsibilities and individual experience, taking into account competitive market compensation
paid by other companies for similar positions within the medical device industry and within the
geographical areas in which we operate.

executive officers. Annual incentive bonuses will be granted based on individual performances that
contribute to our company by achieving corporate goals and creating value for our shareholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Long-Term Incentive Program</I></B>. We believe that long-term individual and corporate performance is
achieved through ownership that incentivizes executive officers through the use of stock and
stock-based awards. To that end, we intend to use equity and equity-based awards to achieve our
compensation goals. We have not adopted formal stock ownership guidelines. Our Board of Directors will consider adopting and implementing an equity incentive plan,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Mikhail
Kvitnitsky Employment Agreement, as Terminated as of June&nbsp;23,
2008</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;31, 2005, Mikhail Kvitnitsky entered into an employment agreement with Accin
Corporation, under which he served as Chief Executive Officer of Accin. Accin assigned this
agreement to Cardo&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Accelerated Innovation, LLC, on May&nbsp;21, 2007, along
with substantially all of the other assets of Accin. On June&nbsp;6, 2008, Mr.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky and
Accelerated entered into an amendment to this employment agreement to remove references to a
shareholders agreement for Accin. On June&nbsp;23, 2008, Cardo acquired all of the ownership interests in Accelerated held by Accin, and
Accelerated became the wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardo. Upon the closing of this acquisition, Mr.
Kvitnitsky and Accelerated terminated Mr.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky&#146;s employment agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Prior to
its termination, the term of the employment agreement was from June&nbsp;1, 2005 through May&nbsp;30, 2008, with automatic
renewal thereafter for successive one-year periods ending on each May&nbsp;30, unless (i)&nbsp;either party
elected to terminate the employment agreement at the end of the then-current term by giving the
other party four months&#146; advance written notice, or unless the
agreement was earlier terminated by Accelerated for &#147;Cause&#148;
or by Mr. Kvitnitsky for &#147;Good Reason,&#148; as defined in the
employment agreement. The employment agreement was automatically
renewed for one year on May&nbsp;30, 2008 and terminated by mutual
agreement effective June&nbsp;23, 2008.
Under this employment agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky was entitled to receive the following compensation
and benefits:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mikhail Kvitnitsky
is entitled to receive 5% of net receipts from the sale of the Align 360 unicompartmental knee
product. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, Accin (the party from which Cardo acquired its
medical device business in 2007) paid $100,000 to Mr.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky under this arrangement, and paid
him $6,863 for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2007 through May&nbsp;21, 2007 (the date of sale of Accin&#146;s
business to Cardo). For the period from May&nbsp;21, 2007 through December&nbsp;31, 2007, Accelerated (which
acquired Accin&#146;s medical device business) paid $22,918 to Mr.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky under this arrangement,

for CKST, on an at-will basis pursuant to an employment offer letter dated September&nbsp;5, 2008.
This offer letter provides that Mr.&nbsp;Romine will receive an annual base salary of $180,000, a
discretionary bonus of up to a maximum amount of $45,000 based on specific performance objectives
tied to Cardo meeting its financial targets, and reimbursement for normal business expenses. In
addition, he is entitled to participate in all health insurance and employee benefits adopted by
Cardo and is eligible to accrue three weeks of vacation during his first year of employment. The
offer letter also confirmed the grant of options to Mr.&nbsp;Romine exercisable for units of membership
interests in Cardo, which converted into options exercisable for shares of common stock of CKST
upon completion of the Merger. See the section titled &#147;Outstanding Option Grants&#148; below for more

constitutes fraud, deceit, intentional misconduct, a knowing violation of law, recklessness or
gross negligence that materially and adversely has affected or affects the business of Cardo and/or
CKST, a material breach of any of Mr.&nbsp;Romine&#146;s obligations under any written agreement with Cardo

after 15&nbsp;days&#146; written notice from Cardo and/or CKST setting forth in reasonable detail the nature
of the nonperformance. As used in the offer letter, the term &#147;Good Reason&#148; means a material breach
by Cardo and/or CKST of any of their obligations under any written agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Romine, a
substantial and unusual reduction in his duties, responsibilities or authority, or receipt of
instructions to take actions in violation of law that has not been cured after 15&nbsp;days&#146; written
notice from Mr.&nbsp;Romine to Cardo and/or CKST setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the
action giving rise to the claim of Good Reason.

21,400 shares of CKST&#146;s common stock with exercise prices ranging from $0.50 to $24.69 and expiring
between 2010 and 2014. All of these options remain outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2008, Cardo issued options exercisable for units of membership interests in Cardo with an
exercise price of $147,625 per unit (which is not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant). Each option has a term of 10&nbsp;years and vests in equal installments over a five-year period
commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. In connection with the Merger, these
options converted into options exerciseable for shares of CKST&#146;s common stock with an exercise
price of $0.22126 per share (which is not less than the fair market value on the date of grant).
The following table provides information with respect to (i)&nbsp;the name and relation of the optionee
to Cardo, (ii)&nbsp;the number of units of membership interests in Cardo that may be acquired pursuant

to make down payments on its purchase of the interests in Cervical Xpand and Uni-Knee from their
minority holders. In connection with this indebtedness, Cardo granted a security interest in
certain collateral pursuant to a Security Agreement, dated as of February&nbsp;6, 2008, by and between
Cardo and this individual. Our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew A.
Brooks, M.D., guaranteed the indebtedness under the Secured Promissory Note. Cardo discharged all
of its obligations and liabilities under this Secured Promissory Note by repaying the original
principal amount of $1.2&nbsp;million plus $48,329 in accrued interest on July&nbsp;3, 2008. The lender has
released all security interests and the guaranty made by Dr.&nbsp;Brooks.

August&nbsp;29, 2008, the date of closing of the Merger, 203,360,222 shares of common stock are
outstanding and are held of record by 150 persons (which reflects a one-for-ten reverse stock split
that took effect on March&nbsp;13, 2008). Holders of common stock are entitled to (i)&nbsp;one vote for each
share at all meetings of shareholders, (ii)&nbsp;receive, subject to the prior rights of holders, if
any, of outstanding stock having prior rights as to dividends, dividends as may be declared by the
Board of Director, and (iii)&nbsp;subject to the prior rights of holders, if any, of outstanding stock
having prior rights as to asset distributions, our remaining assets upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of our company. The holders of common stock have no preemptive or other subscription
or conversion rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common
stock. All shares of common stock now outstanding are fully paid and nonassessable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share,
without further shareholder approval (except as may be required by applicable law or stock exchange
regulations). The Board of Directors is authorized to determine, without any further action by the
holders of the common stock, the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights,
rights and terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund terms of any series of
preferred stock, as well as the number of shares constituting such series and the designation
thereof. Should the Board of Directors elect to exercise its authority, the rights and privileges
of holders of the common stock could be made subject to the rights and privileges of any series of
preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock are outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">These provisions give the Board of Directors the power to approve the issuance of a series of
preferred stock that could, depending on its terms, either impede or facilitate the completion of a
merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt. For example, the issuance of new shares might
impede a business transaction if the terms of those shares include series voting rights which would
enable a holder to block business transactions or the issuance of new shares might facilitate a
business transaction if those shares have general voting rights sufficient to cause an applicable
percentage vote requirement to be satisfied.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our payment of dividends, if any, in the future rests within the discretion of our Board of
Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and
financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. Prior to the closing of the Merger, CKST
effectuated various stock splits and dividends. Most recently, on March&nbsp;13, 2008, CKST effectuated
a one-for-ten reverse stock split on our common stock.

In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility we may obtain may preclude us from

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Trades of our common stock are conducted on the OTC Bulletin Board and, as soon as is practicable,
we anticipate applying for listing of our common stock on the American Stock Exchange. We cannot
ensure that we will be able to satisfy the listing standards of the American Stock Exchange or that
our common stock will be accepted for listing. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing
standards of the American Stock Exchange, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing and
remains listed on the OTC Bulletin Board or suspended from the OTC Bulletin Board, the trading
price of our common stock could suffer, the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid
and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.

stock may be sold without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
approximately 202,367,259 outstanding shares of our common stock are not eligible for resale under
the Securities Act without restriction, for a period of at least one year following the filing of
this report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Also, approximately 148,638,024, or 73.1%, of the outstanding shares of our common stock (included
in the restricted shares indicated above) are subject to lockup agreements which limit sales for a
two-year period. As a result, 43,444,619 of our outstanding shares which are not currently
eligible for resale will become eligible for resale after one year after we file this report and an
additional 148,638,024 of our outstanding shares will become eligible for resale after two years
from the closing date of the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If our shareholders whose shares become eligible for resale do sell, or indicate an intention to
sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the legal and contractual
restrictions on resale discussed in this filing lapse, the trading price of our common stock could
decline.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Section&nbsp;145(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the GCL, permits a
corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation), by
reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with that action, suit or proceeding if the person
acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the person&#146;s conduct was unlawful. Our Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, or the Certificate, requires us to so indemnify any person, according
to the above terms, who is or was a director or officer of ours or who served as an officer or
director of another entity at our request as described above. The Certificate permits us to extend
these indemnification rights to any employee or agent of ours or any other person if permitted to
do so by our Amended and Restated Bylaws or upon the approval of the Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As permitted under Section 145(b) of the GCL, we may indemnify any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the
person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of that
action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. However, in such an action by or on
behalf of a corporation, no indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as
to which the person is adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless, and only to the extent that
the court determines that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for those expenses which
the court deems proper.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Section&nbsp;145(e) of the GCL permits a corporation, and the Certificate requires us, to advance
expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, and such expenses may be paid
by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of that action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the advanced amount
if it ultimately is determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation
as authorized in Section&nbsp;145(e). The Certificate also permits us to extend these advancement of
expenses rights to any employee or agent of ours or to others if permitted to do so by our Amended
and Restated Bylaws or upon the approval of the Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by Section&nbsp;145 of the GCL
will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in the person&#146;s official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding office. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and will
inure to the benefit of the persons&#146; heirs, executors and administrators.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, the Certificate provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of
the registrant will be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director. However, this does not eliminate or limit liability of a director
(1)&nbsp;for any breach of the director&#146;s duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders, (2)&nbsp;for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(3)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the GCL (for unlawful payments of dividends, stock purchases or
redemptions) or (4)&nbsp;for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Certificate also provides that we may enter into one or more agreements with any person which
provide for indemnification greater or different than that provided in the Certificate. We have
entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers, in addition to
indemnification provided for in the Certificate, and intend to enter into indemnification
agreements with any new directors and executive officers in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, Section 145(g) of the GCL provides that a corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against that person and incurred by that person in that official
capacity, or arising out of the person&#146;s status as such, regardless of whether the corporation is
empowered to indemnify that person under the provisions of law. We have purchased insurance
pursuant to which our directors and officers are insured against liability which they may incur in
their capacity as such.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cardo Medical, LLC (the
&#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations, members&#146;
deficit, and cash flows for the period from April&nbsp;6, 2007, inception to December&nbsp;31, 2007. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cardo Medical, LLC as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from inception, April&nbsp;6, 2007 to
December&nbsp;31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Organization</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cardo Medical, LLC (&#147;Cardo&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was organized on April&nbsp;6, 2007 as a California
limited liability company. Shortly after the formation of Accelerated Innovation, LLC
(&#147;Accelerated&#148;), a Delaware limited liability company, the Company acquired 37.5% of the membership
interest in Accelerated. Accelerated owns 51.21% of Uni-Knee, LLC (&#147;Uni&#148;), a New Jersey limited
liability company, and 52.083% of Cervical Xpand, LLC (&#147;Cervical&#148;), a New Jersey limited liability
company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;19, 2008 (unaudited), the Company exercised the option to acquire the 62.5% non-controlling
interest of Accelerated, held by Accin Corporation (&#147;Accin&#148;), a New Jersey Corporation (see Note
6).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;23, 2008 (unaudited), the Company completed its acquisition from the minority interest
members of Uni and Cervical to acquire the remaining interests not owned by Accelerated of 48.79%
and 47.917%, respectively (see Note 7).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Nature of Business</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company develops and distributes reconstructive orthopedic and spinal surgery products to
various medical organizations. The Company works in small, focused development teams in
conjunction with physicians to rapidly develop products from conception to launch. The Company
launched and commenced sales of its first product in late 2006, which was a high-performance,
uni-compartmental knee replacement. The Company commenced sales of its reconstructive and hip
products in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Management&#146;s Plan</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had losses from operations and
negative cash flows from operations. The Company also had limited resources to fund the payments
necessary to complete the business combination of Accelerated (see Note 7). These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management&#146;s plan regarding these matters included a private placement of membership interests on
June&nbsp;18, 2008, in which the Company raised $12,975,000 (see Note 8). The capital raised in this
private placement was adequate to cover the payments necessary to complete the business combination
of Accelerated, and the Company expects that this capital will be sufficient to fund operations for
the next 12&nbsp;months.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Basis of Presentation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Principles of Consolidation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cardo, Accelerated, Uni and Cervical.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
non-controlling and minority interests in these companies is represented by a single balance in the
consolidated balance sheets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the total non-controlling interest balance of
$633,685 is comprised of $76,372 for minority interest in Uni, ($42,825) in Cervical and $600,138
in Accelerated. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008 (unaudited), the non-controlling interest balance amounted to
$0, as the Company by then had acquired the minority interests in Uni, Cervical, and Accelerated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things, management makes estimates
relating to allowances for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory items, the estimated
depreciable lives of property and equipment and the allocation of the purchase price paid for the
minority interests in Uni, Cervical and Accelerated. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times
may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to this
concentration of risk.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Accounts Receivable</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company periodically assesses its accounts receivable for collectability on a specific
identification basis. If collectability of an account becomes unlikely, an allowance is recorded
for that doubtful account. Once collection efforts have been exhausted, the account receivable is
written off against the allowance. The Company does not require collateral for trade accounts
receivable and has not experienced any write-offs. Management believes that all accounts
receivable as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and June&nbsp;30, 2008 (unaudited)&nbsp;are collectable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Inventory</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in,
first-out basis; and the inventory is comprised of work in process and finished goods. Work in
process consists of fabrication costs paid relating to items not physically received. Finished
goods are completed knee, spine and hip replacement products ready for sales to customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and
obsolescence. This evaluation includes an analysis of sales levels by product type. Among other
factors, the Company considers current product configurations, historical and forecasted demand,
market conditions and product life cycles when determining the net realizable value of the
inventory. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net
realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost
basis of the excess or obsolete inventory. The Company did not have any inventory considered by
management to be excess or obsolete as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and June&nbsp;30, 2008 (unaudited).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Property and Equipment</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years. When items are retired or
disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between the net book value of the
asset and the proceeds realized thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred, and replacements and betterments are capitalized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Other Assets</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the period of April&nbsp;6, 2007, inception, through December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company entered into
agreements with two manufacturers to market and distribute the Company&#146;s uni-polar and mono-polar
hip products, as well as its pedicle screw and cervical plate systems. As part of these
agreements, the manufacturers granted non-exclusive licenses to the Company to use certain
information and improvements so that the Company may obtain regulatory approval for the products
that are the subject of the agreements, and in connection with the Company&#146;s commercialization of
those products. The total costs capitalized as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 and June&nbsp;30, 2008 amounted to
$125,000 and $255,000 (unaudited), respectively. During the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, the
Company paid an additional $130,000 (unaudited)&nbsp;in additional license fees relating to these
products. The amounts are being amortized using the straight-line method over a period of five
years, which represents the contractual life of the agreement. Amortization of the license fees
commenced in September&nbsp;2007 and amounted to $12,500 for the

the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; the Company evaluates long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not
be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected
undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their
estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on
the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or
discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the
determination is made. The Company&#146;s management currently believes there is no impairment of its
long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or
demand for the Company&#146;s products will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment
of long-lived assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable, account payable and accrued

the note payable, the carrying amount approximates its fair value due to its short maturity and
interest rate commensurate with the interest rate the Company could get in the open market.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued SFAS No.&nbsp;161,
&#147;Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#151;an amendment of FASB Statement
No.&nbsp;133.&#148; This standard requires companies to provide enhanced disclosures about (a)&nbsp;how and why
an entity uses derivative instruments, (b)&nbsp;how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and (c)&nbsp;how derivative
instruments and related hedged items affect an entity&#146;s financial position, financial performance,
and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The Company
has adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;161, but since the Company does not have any derivative
instruments or hedging activities, the adoption did not have any impact on its financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;110
(&#147;SAB 110&#148;) regarding the use of a &#147;simplified&#148; method, as discussed in SAB No.&nbsp;107 (&#147;SAB 107&#148;), in
developing an estimate of expected term of &#147;plain vanilla&#148; share options in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. In
particular, the staff indicated in SAB 107 that it will accept a company&#146;s election to use the
simplified method, regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more
refined estimates of expected term. At the time SAB 107 was issued, the staff believed that more
detailed external information about employee exercise behavior (e.g., employee exercise patterns by
industry and/or other categories of companies) would, over time, become readily available to
companies. Therefore, the staff stated in SAB 107 that it would not expect a company to use the
simplified method for share option grants after December&nbsp;31, 2007. The staff understands that such
detailed information about employee exercise behavior may not be widely available by December&nbsp;31,
2007. Accordingly, the staff will continue to accept, under certain circumstances, the use of the
simplified method beyond December&nbsp;31, 2007. The
Company currently does not have stock options outstanding, but it will follow the guidance in SAB
110 if it grants any options in the future. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have any
impact on the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements&#151;an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51.&#148; This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Before this Statement was issued, limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling
interests. As a result, considerable diversity in practice existed. So-called minority interests
were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the
mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. This Statement improves comparability by
eliminating that diversity. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008 (that is, January&nbsp;1, 2009, for
entities with calendar year-ends). Earlier adoption is prohibited. The effective date of this
Statement is the same as that of the related Statement 141 (revised 2007). The Company will adopt
this Statement beginning January&nbsp;1, 2009. It is not believed that this will have an impact on the
Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB, issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141 (revised 2007), &#147;Business Combinations.&#148; This
Statement replaces FASB Statement No.&nbsp;141, &#147;Business Combinations,&#148; but retains the fundamental
requirements in Statement 141. This Statement establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer: (a)&nbsp;recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,
the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquire; (b)&nbsp;recognizes and
measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and
(c)&nbsp;determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This Statement applies prospectively
to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before
that date. The effective date of this Statement is the same as that of the related FASB Statement
No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; The Company will adopt
this Statement beginning January&nbsp;1, 2009. It is not believed that this will have an impact on the
Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Liabilities&#151;Including an Amendment of SFAS 115.&#148; This standard permits an entity to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This option is available
to all entities. Most of the provisions in SFAS No.&nbsp;159 are elective; however, an amendment to SFAS
No.&nbsp;115 &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities&#148; applies to all entities
with available for sale or trading securities. Some requirements apply differently to entities that
do not report net income. SFAS No.&nbsp;159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity&#146;s first fiscal
year that begins after November&nbsp;15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the
previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120&nbsp;days of that
fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157
&#147;Fair Value Measurements.&#148; We adopted SFAS No.&nbsp;159 beginning January&nbsp;1, 2008 and it had no impact
on our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP No.&nbsp;FIN 48-1, &#147;Definition of Settlement in FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;48,&#148; (FSP FIN 48-1). FSP FIN 48-1 was issued May&nbsp;2, 2007 and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">amends FIN 48 to
provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled
for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term &#147;effectively settled&#148;
replaces the term &#147;ultimately settled&#148; when used to describe recognition, and the terms
&#147;settlement&#148; or &#147;settled&#148; replace the terms &#147;ultimate settlement&#148; or &#147;ultimately settled&#148; when used
to describe measurement of a tax position under FIN 48. FSP FIN 48-1 clarifies that a tax position
can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without
being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would
recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely
than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of
limitations remains open. As the Company is a tax flow-through entity, and is not itself an income
taxpayer, the adoption of FSP FIN 48-1 did not have an impact on the accompanying financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, &#147;Fair Value Measurements.&#148; This Statement defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having
previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement
attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. However,
for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practice. This Statement
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the
reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including financial
statements for an interim period within that fiscal year. The Company adopted this Statement
January&nbsp;1, 2008, and it did not have an impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#151; an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109,&#148; which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#148; This interpretation prescribes a
comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its
financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return,
including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction. Under
the Interpretation, the financial statements must reflect expected future tax consequences of these
positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
The Interpretation also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive annual,
tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006, including the Company&#146;s 2008 fiscal year, although early
adoption is permitted. As the Company&#146;s form of organization is an LLC, it is not an income tax
payer. Consequently, the adoption of this Interpretation had no impact on the Company&#146;s financial
statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>6. ACCIN TRANSACTION</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On April&nbsp;6, 2007, Cardo was organized by a group of investors who made an initial capital
contribution amounting to an aggregate of $5,000,000. On May&nbsp;21, 2007, (1)&nbsp;Cardo contributed
$3,750,000 to Accelerated and (2)&nbsp;Accin, a related party company through a common owner,
contributed all of its net business assets, with a net book value of $866,819, to Accelerated. In
exchange for this contribution, Cardo received 37.5% of the ownership interests in Accelerated and
Accin received the remaining 62.5% of the ownership interests.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Concurrent with the above transaction, on May&nbsp;21, 2007, the $3,750,000 contributed by Cardo was
distributed by Accelerated to Accin. In this transaction, Cardo received a one-year option to
purchase the remaining 62.5% of the ownership interests in Accelerated held by Accin for $6,250,000
(see Note 7).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Upon analysis of the Accin contribution, and by applying the precepts found in Emerging Issues Task
Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;98-3, &#147;Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of
Productive Assets or of a Business,&#148; it was determined that the net assets constituted a business.
This was based on the inputs, outputs, customer base and processes of the operation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Therefore, it was determined that the transaction was a business combination subject to the
guidance of SFAS No.&nbsp;141, &#147;Business Combinations.&#148; Under that guidance, since Cardo obtained
control of the operations despite not having majority ownership, Cardo was the acquirer for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, the transaction was recorded as a purchase, and the accounts of
Accelerated were consolidated with those of Cardo.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">However, since the assets contributed by Accin were in exchange for ownership interests in
Accelerated, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5, the assets were recorded on the
books of Accelerated at Accin&#146;s historical cost basis.

ACQUISITION OF NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS (unaudited)</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;7, 2008 (unaudited), the Company entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreements
(the &#147;Agreements&#148;) pursuant to which it agreed to purchase the minority interests in Uni and
Cervical subject to certain conditions prior to closing. Together with the execution of the
Agreements, Cardo made deposits to the minority interest holders of Uni and Cervical in the
aggregate amount of $1,160,484. On June&nbsp;23, 2008 (unaudited), the Company paid an additional
$2,326,206 to the minority interest holders of Uni and Cervical to close the acquisition. As a
result, the Company became the 100% owner of all interests in Uni and Cervical.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On June&nbsp;19, 2008 (unaudited), the Company
exercised its option to acquire the non-controlling
interest in Accelerated for $6,250,000 (see Note 6). Of this amount, $6,150,000 (unaudited)&nbsp;was
paid to Accin as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and $100,000 (unaudited)
was held for payment of acquisition costs, with any amounts left over due to the minority interest
holders. The amount has been reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June&nbsp;30, 2008 (unaudited).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s acquisition of the Uni, Cervical
and Accelerated minority interest have been
accounted for using the purchase accounting method. The financial statements reflect the
allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on
their estimated fair
values as of the acquisition date. The Company&#146;s allocation of purchase price is as follows.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Accin Corporation as of December&nbsp;31, 2006
and May&nbsp;31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and for the five months ended May&nbsp;31, 2007 in conformity with accounting

the state of New Jersey. The Company owns 51.21% of Uni-Knee, LLC (&#147;Uni&#148;), a New Jersey limited
liability company, and 52.083% of Cervical Xpand, LLC (&#147;Cervical&#148;), a New Jersey limited liability

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company develops and distributes reconstructive orthopedic and spinal surgery products to
various hospitals. The Company works in small, focused development teams in conjunction with

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Accin, Uni and Cervical. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As Accin has owned
majority interests in Uni and Cervical since their formation, the accounts of these companies are
included in their entirety. The minority interest in these companies is represented by a single
balance in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the total minority interest
balance of $211,785 was comprised of $98,052 in minority interest for Uni and $113,733 for minority
interest in Cervical. As of May&nbsp;31, 2007, the total minority interest of $84,232 was comprised of
$3,809 in minority interest in Uni and $80,423 in minority interest in Cervical.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things, management makes estimates
relating to allowances for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory items and estimated
depreciable lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which at times may
exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to this
concentration of risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Accounts Receivable</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company periodically assesses its accounts receivable for collectability on a specific
identification basis. If collectability of an account becomes unlikely, an allowance is recorded
for that doubtful account. Once collection efforts have been exhausted, the account receivable is
written off against the allowance. The Company does not require collateral for trade accounts
receivable. The Company&#146;s sales commenced late during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and
escalated during the period from January&nbsp;1, 2007 through May&nbsp;31, 2007. There have been no
receivable write-offs during that period. Management believes that all accounts receivable as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006 and May&nbsp;31, 2007 are collectable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Inventory</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in,
first-out basis; and the inventory is comprised of work in process and finished goods. Work in
process consists of fabrication, calibration and cleaning costs paid relating to items at various
stages of production, but not yet physically received. Finished goods are completed knee, spine
and hip replacement products ready for sales to customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and
obsolescence. This evaluation includes an analysis of sales levels by product type. Among other
factors, the Company considers current product configurations, historical and forecasted demand,
market conditions and product life cycles when determining the net realizable value of the
inventory. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net
realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost
basis of the excess or obsolete inventory. The Company did not have any inventory considered by
management to be excess or obsolete as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 or May&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years. When items are retired or

the Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances
exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the
related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective
carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair
value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and
is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company&#146;s management currently
believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that
market conditions will not change or demand for the Company&#146;s products will continue. Either of
these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.

hedged items affect an entity&#146;s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This
Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods

the provisions of this pronouncement; however it is not expected to have an impact on the Company&#146;s
financial position, operations or cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;110 (&#147;SAB 110&#148;) regarding the use of
a &#147;simplified&#148; method, as discussed in SAB No.&nbsp;107 (&#147;SAB 107&#148;), in developing an estimate of
expected term of &#147;plain vanilla&#148; share options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. In particular, the staff indicated in SAB
107 that it will accept a company&#146;s election to use the simplified method, regardless of whether
the company has sufficient information to make more refined estimates of expected term. At the time
SAB 107 was issued, the staff believed that more detailed external information about employee
exercise behavior (e.g., employee exercise patterns by industry and/or other categories of
companies) would, over time, become readily available to companies. Therefore, the staff stated in
SAB 107 that it would not expect a company to use the simplified method for share option grants
after December&nbsp;31, 2007. The staff understands that such detailed information about employee
exercise behavior may not be widely available by December&nbsp;31, 2007. Accordingly, the staff will
continue to accept, under certain circumstances, the use of the simplified method beyond December
31, 2007. The Company currently does not have stock options outstanding and has not adopted the
provisions of this pronouncement. Going forward, this is not expected to have an impact on the

reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Before this Statement was issued, limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling
interests. As a result, considerable diversity in practice existed. So-called minority interests
were reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as liabilities or in the
mezzanine section between liabilities and equity. This Statement improves comparability by
eliminating that diversity. This Statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008 (that is, January&nbsp;1, 2009, for
entities with calendar year-ends). Earlier adoption is prohibited. The effective date of this

provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled
for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term &#145;&#145;effectively

when used to describe measurement of a tax position under FIN 48. FSP FIN 48-1 clarifies that a tax
position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority
without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity
would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more
likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute

(&#147;Accelerated&#148;) and (2)&nbsp;Cardo Medical LLC (&#147;Cardo&#148;) contributed $3.75&nbsp;million. In exchange for
these contributions, Accin got 62.5% and Cardo got 37.5% of Accelerated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Concurrent with the above transaction, on May&nbsp;21, 2007, the $3.75&nbsp;million contributed by Cardo was
distributed out of Accelerated into Accin for distribution to Accin shareholders. In exchange,
Accin granted Cardo a one-year option to purchase the remaining 62.5% of the ownership interests in
Accelerated from Accin for $6.25&nbsp;million.

Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;98-3, &#147;Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of
Productive Assets or of a Business,&#148; it was determined that the net assets constituted a business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Therefore, it was determined that the transaction was a business combination subject to the
guidance of SFAS No.&nbsp;141, &#147;Business Combinations.&#148; Under that guidance, since Cardo obtained
control of the operation despite not having majority ownership, Cardo was the acquirer for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, the transaction was recorded as a sale, and the accounts of
Accelerated were consolidated with those of Cardo, not Accin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">However, since the assets contributed by Accin were in exchange for ownership interests in
Accelerated, in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5, the assets were recorded on

As a result of that sale, Accin recognized a gain of approximately $2,900,000 on June&nbsp;1, 2007
representing the difference between the $3.75&nbsp;million it received in the above transaction and the
net book value of the assets it contributed of $866,819.

each Adjusted Parent Option shall equal (A)&nbsp;the per Cardo Unit exercise price of the
Cardo Option to which such Adjusted Parent Option relates divided by (B)&nbsp;the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Parent shall grant each

Escrow Agent hereunder by supplement hereto. If a successor escrow agent is not appointed within
ten (10)&nbsp;days after notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction to name a successor escrow agent. CNS and the Members&#146; Representatives may, at any
time, appoint a successor escrow agent upon fifteen (15)&nbsp;days prior written notice to the Escrow
Agent executed by CNS and the Members&#146; Representatives.

Release Date, CNS shall pay to the Escrow Agent $50.00 as the monthly Escrow fee, upon receipt from
the Escrow Agent of an invoice for such amount.

ultimately delivers Escrowed Property to CNS in satisfaction of such Claim, the Escrow Agent shall
add $500 to the value of the Claim to determine the amount of Escrowed Property to disburse to CNS,
to thereby reimburse CNS for such $500.

liabilities, losses, actions, suits, proceedings at law or in equity, or any other expenses, fees
or charges of any nature whatsoever, which it may incur or with which it may be threatened by
reason of its acting as Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement; and in connection therewith CNS
shall indemnify the Escrow Agent against any and all expenses including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees
and the costs of defending any action, suit or proceedings or resisting any claim in such capacity;
provided, however, that in the event of a dispute between CNS and the Members&#146; Representatives, the
nonprevailing party shall indemnify and hold the prevailing party harmless against any and all
costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party pursuant to the provisions hereof, including
without limitation attorneys fees and costs and all cost incurred in connection with indemnifying

bodies having jurisdiction over the
Company. The exercise of the Option

not exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days in length, during which the
Option shall not be exercisable

exercise of the Option shall not be

a lessening of any restriction on

Securities Act or any applicable
state securities laws for the
issuance or transfer of any
securities. Such limitations on
exercise shall not alter the vesting
schedule set forth in this Agreement
other than to limit the periods

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;</B><U><B>General</B></U>. The number and class of Units (or fractions thereof) subject to each
outstanding Option and the Exercise Price per Unit (or fraction thereof) shall be proportionately
adjusted in the event of (a)&nbsp;a split-up or consolidation of Units, (b)&nbsp;the payment of any dividend

adjustment, so that upon exercise of the Option, the Optionee shall receive the number and class of
securities (or fractions thereof) such Optionee would have received had such Optionee been the
holder of the number of Units (or fractions thereof) for which the Option is being exercised upon
the date of such change or increase or decrease in the number of issued Units.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Reorganization</B></U>. Upon (a)&nbsp;a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company
with one or more corporations or other entities as a result of which the Company is not the
surviving entity, or in which the Company survives as a majority-owned Subsidiary of another
corporation or entity, or upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to
another entity, or (b)&nbsp;a transaction in which the Company&#146;s legal structure is converted into a
corporation, partnership or entity other than a limited liability company, or in which the
Company&#146;s state of organization has changed to any state other than California (each a
<B>&#147;Transaction&#148;</B>), adequate adjustment or other provisions shall be made by the Company, or by the
other party to such Transaction, to each outstanding Option (including the number and class of
securities subject to the Option and the Exercise Price (but not the total price)) so that there
shall be substituted for the Units (or fractions thereof) provided for herein, the units, shares,
securities or assets which would have been issuable or payable in respect of or in exchange for the
Units (or fractions thereof) otherwise issuable under such Options, as if the Optionee had been the
owner of such Units (or fractions thereof) as of the effective date of the applicable Transaction.
Any Units (or fractions thereof), shares, securities or assets so substituted shall be subject to
similar successive adjustments. The foregoing notwithstanding, if a Transaction results in a
Change in Control, each outstanding Option shall be subject to the terms of the definitive
agreement(s) providing for the reorganization, merger or consolidation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Reservation of Rights</B></U>. Except as specifically provided in this Schedule&nbsp;B, an
Optionee shall have no rights by reason of (a)&nbsp;any subdivision, consolidation or recapitalization
of the Company&#146;s Units or Membership Interests, (b)&nbsp;the payment of any dividend (whether in
securities, cash or other property), (c)&nbsp;any other increase or decrease in the number of the
Company&#146;s Membership Interests, or (d)&nbsp;any other issuance of securities by the Company. Except as
specifically provided in this Schedule&nbsp;B, any issuance by the Company of Units or Membership
Interests, or securities convertible into or exercisable for Units or Membership Interests, shall
not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or
Exercise Price of Units subject to an Option. The grant of this Option shall not affect in any way
the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or
changes to its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate, to dissolve or liquidate, to
sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets or to enter into any other transaction

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>This TERMINATION AGREEMENT </B>(the <B>&#147;Termination Agreement&#148;</B>) is effective as of June&nbsp;23, 2008 (the
<B>&#147;Effective Date&#148;</B>), by and among Mikhail Kvitnitsky (<B>&#147;Kvitnitsky&#148;</B>) and Accelerated Innovation, LLC,
a California limited liability company (the <B>&#147;Company&#148;</B>), with reference to the following facts:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky entered into an Employment Agreement effective as of January&nbsp;31, 2005 (as
amended, the <B>&#147;Employment Agreement&#148;</B>) with Accin Corporation (<B>&#147;Accin&#148;</B>), under which he served as
Chief Executive Officer of Accin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Accin assigned the Employment Agreement to the Company on May&nbsp;21, 2007, along with
substantially all of the other assets of Accin, as part of a transaction between Accin and Cardo
Medical, LLC (<B>&#147;Cardo&#148;</B>) in which Cardo acquired a 37.5% interest in Accelerated and Accin acquired a
62.5% interest in Accelerated (the <B>&#147;Accelerated Interest&#148;</B>).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Kvitnitsky and the Company entered into an amendment of the Employment Agreement effective
as of June&nbsp;6, 2008 to remove references to a shareholders agreement of Accin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;On the Effective Dated, Cardo acquired the Accelerated Interest held by Accin, and the
Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardo.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;As Kvitnitky serves as the Chief Operating Officer of Cardo, and serves in the same
capacity for the Company (and not as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company), the parties
desire to terminate the Employment Agreement as of the Effective Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Kvitnitsky and the Company hereby agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Termination of Employment Agreement</U>. Effective as of the Effective Date, without
further action by any party, all rights and obligations of the parties under the Employment
Agreement shall be terminated and such agreement shall be of no further force or effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Miscellaneous</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 <U>Successors and Assigns</U>. All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors and assigns of the parties hereto whether so expressed or not.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 <U>Severability</U>. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision
of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Derrick:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this letter is to set forth the basic terms pursuant to which you have agreed
to work for Cardo Medical, LLC (the <B>&#147;Company&#148;</B>) as its Chief Financial Officer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your capacity as Chief Financial Officer, you shall do and perform all services, acts and
things necessary or advisable commensurate with your position to promote the continued success of
the Company&#146;s business, subject to the instructions, policies and limitations which may be set from
time to time by the Managers of the Company (the <B>&#147;Managers&#148;</B>) or its Chief Executive Officer. In
addition, you will be required to have proof of a valid driver&#146;s license and current automobile
insurance on file at all times as you may be requested to drive on Company business from time to
time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your monthly base salary will be $15,000 (the equivalent of $180,000 per year), which will be
subject to review and possible adjustment by the Managers on an annual basis. This salary will be
paid to you in accordance with the Company&#146;s normal payroll policies, and the salary will be
subject to all applicable withholding charges. In addition, you will be eligible to participate in
all health insurance and employee benefit plans adopted by us, which are subject to change from
time to time. Currently, we expect this to include a healthcare plan, which we anticipate adopting
upon the completion of the merger (the <B>&#147;Merger&#148;</B>) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
clickNsettle.com, Inc. (<B>&#147;CKST&#148;</B>). Your participation in these benefits will be subject to the terms
of the applicable benefits plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will reimburse you for normal business expenses, including travel expenses, as
well as mileage on a personal vehicle, incurred and submitted in accordance with Company policy.
Vacation, sick pay and holidays also will be in accordance with Company policy, which, again, is
subject to revision from time to time. Currently, you will be eligible to accrue three weeks of
vacation during your first year of employment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to your base salary and employee benefits, you will be entitled to receive a bonus
up to a maximum amount of $45,000 based on specific performance objectives tied to the Company
meeting its financial targets. The Company targets will be set, and achievement of these targets
will be measured, by the Managers annually, in each case in their discretion. Please be advised
that the Company reserves the right to modify the bonus structure from time to time as it deems
appropriate in its business judgment. You will be provided notice of such modification prior to
its implementation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this confirms your receipt of options exercisable for 0.70443 units of membership
interests in the Company at an exercise price of $147,625 per unit (which is not less than the fair
market value on the date of grant). Upon completion of the Merger, these options converted to
options exercisable for 470,000 shares of the Common Stock of CKST at an exercise price of $0.22126
per share (which is not less than the fair market value on the date of grant). The term of the
option will be 10&nbsp;years, subject to earlier expiration if your services to CKST (following the
Merger) are terminated. The option will vest in five (5)&nbsp;equal installments over five (5)&nbsp;years,
with the first installment vesting on the first

conditions set forth in a standard form of Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is our sincere hope and belief that our relationship will be a long one, the
representations in this letter and from our discussion(s) with you should not be construed in any
matter as a proposed contract for any fixed term. Indeed, you should be aware that your employment
with the Company shall be entirely &#147;at-will&#148;. This means that either you or the Company is free to
terminate our relationship at any time, with or without &#147;Cause&#148; or &#147;Good Reason&#148; (each as defined
below). This &#147;at-will&#148; relationship can only be changed by an agreement in writing signed by you
and the Managers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the &#147;at-will&#148; nature of your employment, if the Company terminates your
employment without Cause, or if you terminate your employment with Good Reason, at any time during
the first two (2)&nbsp;years of your employment (<I>i.e.</I>, on or before September&nbsp;4, 2010), you will be
entitled to the following severance benefits (together, the <B>&#147;Severance Benefits&#148;</B>):
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Company will pay you the sum of six (6)&nbsp;months of your then-current monthly salary as
severance payment to be paid in bi-weekly installments so long as you do not work or otherwise
provide services to a competitor of the Company or CKST during such six (6)-month period. Such
severance payment shall be subject to all applicable payroll withholdings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Fifty percent (50%) of your unvested options will become fully exercisable as of the date
of termination of your employment (the <B>&#147;Termination Date&#148;</B>) and, together with any vest options at
the Termination Date, may be exercised pursuant to the terms thereof within ninety (90)&nbsp;days of the
Termination Date (or one (1)&nbsp;year after the Termination Date if you die during such 90-day period).
The remaining unvested options at the Termination Date, to the extent not then presently
exercisable, shall terminate as of the Termination Date and shall not be exercisable thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a precondition to your receiving the Severance Benefits, the Company may require that you
reconfirm, in writing, you obligations hereunder and execute a general release of any and all
claims you might have against the Company and CKST and their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees and agents, whether arising out of your employment or termination of
employment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are terminated for Cause, or if you voluntarily terminate your employment or resign
from your positions with the Company or CKST without Good Reason, you shall not be entitled to the
Severance Benefits. As used herein, the term <B>&#147;Cause&#148; </B>means an act or omission that constitutes
fraud, deceit, intentional misconduct, a knowing violation of law, recklessness or gross negligence
that materially and adversely has affected or affects the business of the Company and/or CKST, a
material breach of any of your obligations under any written agreement with the Company and/or
CKST, or material nonperformance of your duties to the Company and/or CKST which has not been cured
after 15&nbsp;days&#146; written notice from the Company and/or CKST setting forth in reasonable detail the
nature of the nonperformance. As used herein, the term <B>&#147;Good Reason&#148; </B>means a material breach by
the Company and/or CKST of any of their obligations under any written agreement with you, a
substantial and unusual reduction in your duties, responsibilities or authority, or receipt of
instructions to take actions in violation of law that has not been cured after 15&nbsp;days&#146; written
notice from you to the Company and/or CKST setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the
action giving rise to the claim of Good Reason.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter will constitute the entire understanding between you and the Company with regard
to your employment with us, and shall supersede all previous understandings and agreements, verbal
or written, including, without limitation, the employment offer letter presented to you in February
2008 (the <B>&#147;February Offer Letter&#148;</B>). By signing below, you acknowledge that the February Offer
Letter is void and of no effect and does not create any rights or obligations for you or the
Company.

time except for the policies of at-will employment and the arbitration of disputes), unless these

opportunity to ask us any questions about these forms, or to discuss them with an attorney, prior
to signing them.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is made and entered into as of the
&#95;&#95;&#95; day of <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 2008, by and between clickNsettle.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
&#147;<U>Corporation</U>&#148;), and <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> (&#147;<U>Indemnitee</U>&#148;), with reference to the
following facts:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Indemnitee currently is serving or has been invited to serve as a director and/or officer
of the Corporation, and the Corporation wishes Indemnitee to serve or to continue to serve in such
capacity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the
&#147;<U>Certificate of Incorporation</U>&#148;) provides that the Corporation shall indemnify each person
who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, and each such person who is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, against specified expenses and losses
arising as a result of their services in any such capacity, to the fullest extent permitted from
time to time by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>GCL</U>&#148;) or any other laws as
presently or hereafter in effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Both the Corporation and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other
claims currently being asserted against directors and officers of corporations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;In recognition of Indemnitee&#146;s need for substantial protection against personal liability
in order to enhance Indemnitee&#146;s continued and effective service to the Corporation, and in order
to induce Indemnitee to provide services to the Corporation as a director and/or officer, it is the
intention of this Agreement to provide to Indemnitee certain indemnification rights that are in
addition to those rights described in the Certificate of Incorporation and the Corporation&#146;s
Bylaws.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;As used in this Agreement, the terms &#147;enterprise&#148;, &#147;proceeding&#148; and &#147;expenses&#148; have the
meanings set forth in Section&nbsp;11.1, and the terms &#147;fines&#148;, &#147;serving at the request of the
Corporation&#148; and &#147;not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation&#148; shall be construed in
accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;11.3.
</DIV>

and/or officer of the Corporation, the Corporation agrees with Indemnitee as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <U>Indemnification</U>. The Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee if Indemnitee was, is
or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or
witness or other participant in, any proceeding (including but not limited to a proceeding by or in
the right of the Corporation) by reason of (or arising in part out of) the fact that Indemnitee is
or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another enterprise, against
expenses, judgments, fines, settlement payments and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred
by Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding, and any federal, state, local or foreign taxes
imposed as the result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this

</DIV>


<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>CLICKNSETTLE.COM, INC. AND CARDO MEDICAL, LLC<BR>
ANNOUNCE COMPLETION OF MERGER</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Miami, FL and Los Angeles, CA &#150; September&nbsp;2, 2008 </B>&#150; Cardo Medical, LLC, a company engaged in the
development of orthopedic medical devices, and clickNsettle.com, Inc., a publicly-traded company
with no active operations (&#147;CKST&#148;), completed a merger on August&nbsp;29, 2008, pursuant to a merger
agreement providing for the merger of Cardo with and into Cardo Acquisition, LLC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CKST. Cardo will continue as the surviving entity in the merger and as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CKST.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously reported, on or about the signing of the merger agreement on June&nbsp;18, 2008, a group
of investors led by Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Opko Health, Inc.,
invested approximately $13.0&nbsp;million in Cardo in exchange for units of Cardo&#146;s membership
interests. Cardo used approximately $9.7&nbsp;million of the proceeds from these investments to close
on the acquisition of the remaining outstanding equity interests of three partially owned
subsidiaries of Cardo (Accelerated Innovation, LLC, Cervical Xpand, LLC, and Uni-Knee, LLC), and
Cardo expects to use the remaining funds to accelerate its research and product development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the closing of the merger, each Cardo unit issued and
outstanding was converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 667,204.70995 shares of
common stock of CKST. As a result of the merger, CKST&#146;s stockholders own approximately 5.5% of the
combined company on a fully diluted basis, the members of Cardo, excluding the new investors, own
approximately 64.8% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, the new investors own
approximately 28.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and option holders of Cardo
own approximately 1.2% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In connection with the consummation of the merger, CKST expects to change its name from
&#147;clickNsettle.com, Inc.&#148; to &#147;Cardo Medical, Inc.&#148; CKST&#146;s trading symbol is &#147;CKST.OB,&#148; which the
company expects to change in connection with the name change. CKST intends to apply to have its
shares listed on the American Stock Exchange.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, on the tenth day after filing and transmitting an Information Statement pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule&nbsp;14f-1 thereunder (approximately
September&nbsp;12, 2008), the Board of Directors of Cardo initially will consist of five directors to be
appointed by Dr.&nbsp;Andrew Brooks and two directors to be appointed by Dr.&nbsp;Frost. Dr.&nbsp;Brooks, an
orthopedic surgeon, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and as its
Chairman of the Board. The company is now headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Dr.&nbsp;Brooks commented, &#147;We are pleased to have completed our merger, and are excited to be working
with Dr.&nbsp;Frost and his group as we grow our company into a significant and important source of
innovative product development and distribution for orthopedic reconstructive and spine surgical
devices. I am personally excited and grateful to be in a business which offers the ability to
improve the quality of life and functional abilities of so many patients.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Dr.&nbsp;Frost added, &#147;We are thrilled to partner with the management team of Cardo Medical and look
forward to working with them as they build their exciting company into a world class orthopedic and
spinal device business.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Glenn L. Halpryn, who is the current chairman and president of CKST, stated, &#147;The Board of
Directors of ClickNSettle is very impressed with the management team of Cardo, which combines
orthopedic surgical expertise with business development acumen. Cardo is creating innovative
orthopedic products with the potential to improve patient outcomes, while offering operational
benefits to the providing orthopedic surgeons. Cardo has an established, proprietary product
portfolio, and has already demonstrated numerous promising product development cycles. We believe
Cardo is positioned to compete in a market for orthopedic implants that is expected to grow
substantially in the coming years, as a large segment of the U.S. population begins to reach
retirement age.&#148;
