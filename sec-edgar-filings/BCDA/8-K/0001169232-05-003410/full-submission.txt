Item 4.01   Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

      On January 13,  2005,  clickNsettle.com,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  sold its
alternative dispute resolution business. Since the consummation of the sale, the
Company has no operating business.  Currently, the Company is actively searching
for a new operating business to acquire or to enter into a business combination.
As a consequence of this change,  Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant  Thornton") and the
Company's Board of Directors mutually decided to terminate their relationship so
that  Grant  Thornton  would  no  longer  serve  as  the  Company's  independent
registered public accounting firm, effective as of the date of this report, June
28, 2005.

      Grant  Thornton's  reports on the Company's  financial  statements for the
past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion,
nor were they qualified or modified as to audit scope or accounting  principles.
The  report was  qualified  as to  uncertainty  about the  Company's  ability to
continue  as a going  concern as it had  sustained  significant  losses and used
substantial  amounts  of  cash  in  operations  and  the  uncertainty  as to the
Company's ability to sustain profitable operations.

      During the  Company's  two most recent  fiscal  years and through June 28,
2005,  there  were  no  disagreements  with  Grant  Thornton  on any  matter  of
accounting principles or practices,  financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreements,  if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Grant Thornton,  would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of
the  disagreements in connection with this report.  No reportable  events of the
type described in Item  304(a)(1)(iv)(B)  of Regulation S-B occurred  during the
two most recent fiscal years.

      The Company has provided Grant Thornton with a copy of this disclosure and
requested  that  they  furnish  the  Company  with  a  letter  addressed  to the
Securities & Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees or disagrees with the
statements  by the Company in this report and, if not,  stating the  respects in
which it does not agree. A letter from Grant Thornton to such effect is attached
hereto as Exhibit 16.1.

      Also effective  June 28, 2005, BP Audit Group,  PLLC has been appointed by
the Board of Directors as the new independent  registered public accounting firm
for the Company.

      During its two most recent  fiscal years and through  June 28,  2005,  the
Company  has not  consulted  with BP Audit  Group,  PLLC on any matter  that (i)
involved the  application  of accounting  principles to a specific  completed or
contemplated transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on
the Company's  financial  statements,  in each case where written or oral advice
was provided, that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching
a decision as to the accounting,  auditing or financial  reporting issue or (ii)
was either the subject of a disagreement  or event, as that term is described in
Item 304(a)(1)(iv)(A) of Regulation S-B.
