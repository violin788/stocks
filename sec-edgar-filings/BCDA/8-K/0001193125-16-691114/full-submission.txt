Tiger X Medical, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), Icicle Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), BioCardia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;BioCardia&#148;), Jay
Moyes, as representative of BioCardia&#146;s stockholders and option holders (the &#147;BioCardia Securityholders&#148;), and Steven Rubin, as the initial representative of the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into BioCardia, with BioCardia continuing as the surviving company under the name &#147;BioCardia, Inc.&#148; (the &#147;Merger&#148;).&nbsp;Subject to the satisfaction of customary
and other closing conditions described below, we expect the Merger to close in the third quarter of 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;Effective Time&#148;), each of the shares of BioCardia&#146;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#147;BioCardia Common Stock&#148;), issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including shares of BioCardia Common Stock underlying outstanding BioCardia preferred stock and convertible notes (which shall be converted immediately prior to the Effective Time), shall be converted into the right to receive
such number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;), equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (such shares, the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;).&nbsp;In
aggregate, we expect to issue approximately 230 million shares of our Common Stock in the Merger, subject to a net cash adjustment as described in the Merger Agreement.&nbsp;Furthermore, the parties have agreed to hold back 20% of the Merger
Consideration in connection with a cash adjustment true-up and in connection with BioCardia&#146;s indemnification obligations.&nbsp;Current Company stockholders will retain approximately 230 million shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall assume BioCardia&#146;s stock option plan and equity incentive plan and (ii) each option to
purchase shares of BioCardia Common Stock, whether vested or unvested, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by the Company and converted into an option to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the number of shares of BioCardia Common Stock underlying such option immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by the Preliminary Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at the Adjusted Exercise Price (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) for such assumed option. All of the other terms and conditions applicable to such assumed and converted options, including with respect to vesting, shall continue to apply after the Effective Time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, holders of warrants to purchase BioCardia Common Stock will be permitted to exercise such warrants
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Any unexercised warrants shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. Any holder of a BioCardia warrant who exercises such warrant pursuant to the Merger Agreement prior
to the Effective Time shall be treated as a holder of BioCardia Common Stock in the Merger with respect to any capital stock issued upon exercise.&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the surviving company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding the operation of the business of the Company and BioCardia
prior to closing.&nbsp;The closing of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement and all of the transactions contemplated therein by the stockholders of BioCardia (which such approval has been
delivered), (ii) the conversion of all outstanding shares of BioCardia preferred stock into BioCardia Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, (iii) the conversion of all outstanding principal and accrued interest under BioCardia&#146;s convertible
promissory notes into BioCardia Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, (iv) the absence of laws or orders prohibiting the Merger, (v) the receipt of all required executed lock-up agreements, (vi) BioCardia having at least $3.5 million of Company
Net Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (vii) the Company having at least $19.5 million of Parent Net Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (viii) BioCardia&#146;s delivery of audited financial statements for its prior two fiscal years
and certain other financial statements, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, and (ix) fewer than 20% of the outstanding shares of BioCardia Common Stock being Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The
obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party&#146;s representations and warranties being true and correct in all material respects, the other party having performed its obligations under the Merger
Agreement and BioCardia having not suffered a material adverse effect. </P>

material breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party that is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is delivered, (ii) any law is enacted or any injunction is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that prohibits
the consummation of the Merger, and (iii) if the Merger is not consummated by October 21, 2016.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon completion of the Merger, we will

BioCardia following the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The shares of Common Stock and options to be issued in connection with the Merger are exempt from the
