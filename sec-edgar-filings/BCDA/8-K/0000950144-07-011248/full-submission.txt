Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will, subject to stockholder approval, implement a
one-for-ten reverse stock split, increase its authorized capital stock to 800&nbsp;million shares of
capital stock, consisting of 750&nbsp;million shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company

Purchasers an aggregate number of unregistered shares equal to 51% of the post-reverse split
outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis (the &#147;Shares&#148;). The
purchase price for the sale of the Shares will be an amount equal to net cash and cash equivalents

under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted.
The Company does not own any equity interest, directly or indirectly, in any other Person or
business enterprise. The Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect upon its assets, properties, financial condition, results of operations or business.
The Company has no subsidiaries.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Capitalization</U>. At the date of this Agreement and before giving effect to the
Reverse Split, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)&nbsp;300,000,000 shares of
Common Stock, of which 55,402,762 shares are issued and outstanding, and (ii)&nbsp;5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, of which no shares are issued and outstanding and of which 2,100 shares are
designated as Series&nbsp;A Exchangeable Preferred Stock. The Company has no other class or series of
equity securities authorized, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Except for options to
purchase 213,990 shares of Common Stock at an average exercise price of $0.30 per share, there are
(x)&nbsp;no outstanding options, offers, warrants, conversion rights, contracts or other rights to
subscribe for or to purchase from the Company, or agreements obligating the Company to issue,
transfer, or sell (whether formal or informal, written or oral, firm or contingent), shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company (whether debt, equity, or a combination thereof)
or obligating the Company to grant, extend, or enter into any such agreement and (y)&nbsp;no agreements
or other understandings (whether formal or informal, written or oral, firm or contingent) which
require or may require the Company to repurchase any of its Common Stock. There are no preemptive
or similar rights with respect to the Company&#146;s capital stock. There are no anti-dilution or price
adjustment provisions contained in any security issued by the Company (or in any agreement
providing rights to security holders). The Company is not a party to, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no Stockholder is a party to, any voting agreements, voting trusts, proxies or any other
agreements, instruments or understandings with respect to the voting of any shares of the capital
stock of the Company, or any agreement with respect to the transferability, purchase or redemption
of any shares of the capital stock of the Company. The issue and sale of the Shares to the
Investors does not obligate the Company to issue any shares of capital stock or other securities to
any Person (other than the Investors) and will not result in a right of any holder of Company
securities to adjust the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under such securities. The
outstanding Common Stock is all duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. As of the date hereof, there are: 213,990 shares of common stock reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options and no shares reserved for issuance upon
exercise of outstanding warrants. The Company does not have issued or outstanding any convertible
securities. The Company will not issue any securities prior to the Closing, except as contemplated
in connection with the Reverse Split. Upon issuance of the Shares to the Investors at the Closing,
the Investors shall own 51% of the issued and outstanding Shares of the Company on a fully-diluted
basis.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>clickNsettle.com, Inc. Announces Proposed Sale of 51% of the Company to Investor Group Led by Dr.
Phillip Frost</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">MIAMI, FL &#151; December&nbsp;20, 2007 &#151; clickNsettle.com, Inc. (CLIK.OTC.BB) today announced that it
entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a small group of investors, led by Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost.
The agreement calls for clickNsettle.com to, subject to shareholder approval, implement a
one-for-ten reverse stock split, increase its authorized common and preferred shares, and sell to
the investor group unregistered shares constituting 51% of its post-reverse split outstanding
shares on a fully-diluted basis. The purchase price is expected to be an amount equal to
approximately net cash and cash equivalents of the Company on the closing date after deducting
liabilities and costs, including costs and expenses of this transaction. The Company expects that
closing of the transactions will occur during the first quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Dr.&nbsp;Frost is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Opko Health, Inc., a specialty healthcare
company focused on the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of ophthalmic diseases. Previously, Dr.
Frost founded IVAX Corporation and served as its Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief
Executive Officer from 1987 until its sale to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., in January
2006. Dr.&nbsp;Frost has served as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Teva since the completion
of the acquisition of IVAX.
