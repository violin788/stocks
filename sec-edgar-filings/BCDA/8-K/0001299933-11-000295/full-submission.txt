	Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<FONT SIZE="2">
On January 24, 2011, Cardo Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cardo"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Arthrex, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), and Cardo Medical, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Cardo ("Cardo LLC" and together with Cardo, the "Sellers"), pursuant to which the Sellers have agreed to sell all of the assets of the Sellers' joint arthroplasty division, which we refer to as our Reconstructive Division, to the Buyer in exchange for cash consideration of $9,960,000 plus the value of the Sellers' inventory and property, plant and equipment relating to the Reconstructive Division calculated as of the closing date, the assumption by the Buyer of certain liabilities, and the payment of a royalty equal to 5% of net sales of the Sellers&#x2019; joint arthroplasty products to be paid in cash on a quarterly basis for a term up to and including the 20th anniversary of the closing date (the "Asset Purchase Agreement").  Following the exe
cution of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer delivered to the Sellers a $250,000 deposit to be credited against the cash consideration due at closing.  From the cash consideration paid at closing, $900,000 will be deposited with an escrow agent for a period of twelve months from the closing date to be used for any adjustments to the value of the Sellers' inventory and property, plant and equipment relating to the Reconstructive Division and for post closing indemnification claims which may be asserted by the Buyer with respect to unassumed liabilities.  Cardo estimates that the value of the Sellers&#x2019; inventory and property, plant and equipment relating to the Reconstructive Division as of the closing date will be approximately $4.7 million.  <br><br>The assets that are excluded from the asset purchase transaction include, the assets of the Sellers' Spine division, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other receivables of each Seller.  With respect to the royalty pay
ments due under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer will have a right to set-off against the payment of any royalty due to the Sellers, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in good faith, after consultation with counsel, by the Buyer arising out of claims by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.  If it is ultimately determined that such costs and expenses were not due to the Buyer, then any royalty that the Buyer exercised its right of set-off against shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date such royalty is payable until the date it is paid.  Additionally, until such time as the royalty has achieved a net present value of $3.0 million, the Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the sale of the subject products during the royalty term.  The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, conditions to closing, and termination provisions.  <br><br>Cardo intends to use the proceeds f
rom this asset purchase transaction to pay: (i) accrued salaries and payroll taxes, (ii) sums due certain creditors, (iii) transaction expenses, and (iv) working capital purposes.  Following the closing of the asset purchase transaction, Cardo plans to continue as a public company with its shares of common stock continuing to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board.  Cardo is continuing to explore other strategic alternatives for its Spine division.  Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, immediately after the closing, the Sellers are required to change their names, logos, trade dress, trade names, trademarks, service marks and the like to new names that are reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and do not use the words "Cardo" or any variation thereof.  Upon the closing of the asset purchase transaction, Cardo intends to change its name to Tiger X Medical, Inc. and Cardo LLC intends to change its name to Tiger X Medical, LLC.  As a result, Cardo also plans to change its trading symbol.  <br><br>Cardo
's and the Buyer's Board of Directors have approved and adopted the Asset Purchase Agreement.  Additionally, Cardo&#x2019;s Board of Directors approved, subject to stockholder approval and the closing of the asset purchase transaction, an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change the name of Cardo to Tiger X Medical, Inc. (the "Name Change").  Cardo's Board of Directors recommended to the holders of a majority of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock that they approve the Asset Purchase Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby, and the Name Change.  Certain stockholders of Cardo holding an aggregate of 133,689,430 shares of Cardo's common stock, representing 58% of Cardo's shares of common stock outstanding, signed a written consent approving the Asset Purchase Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby, and the Name Change.  Cardo will mail to its stockholders an information statement describing the terms of the written consent and the transaction, which mailing will 
occur only after the information statement has been filed and cleared with the SEC staff.  The closing of the asset purchase transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including that at least 20 calendar days have passed since Cardo mailed the definitive information statement to its stockholders.  <br><br>The description of the Asset Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of such agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.  A copy of the press release announcing the asset purchase transaction is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.<br>

	Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<FONT SIZE="2">
As described in Item 1.01, on January 24, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the sale of all of the assets of our Reconstructive Division to Arthrex, Inc. (the "Buyer"). In connection with the sale, we expect to eliminate certain employee positions that will not move to the Buyer and will not be required for future operation of our business and liquidate remaining spine inventory and certain furniture and fixtures. Such terminations are contingent upon the closing of the sale of the Reconstructive Division assets. <br><br>Our management estimates that the total pre-tax charge relating to the sale will be in the range of $650,000 to $750,000. The charge will consist of (i) employee termination costs of approximately $100,000, (ii) transaction costs of approximately $500,000 and (iii) other related costs of up to approximately $150,000. We expect the sale of such assets to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2011, although this is subject to the condition that at least 20 calendar days have pass
ed since Cardo mailed the definitive information statement to its stockholders. We expect that the costs associated with the sale of assets will be incurred beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 and will be substantially completed by the end of 2011 except for certain of the remaining operating lease payments which run through July 2012.<br><br>Our Clifton, NJ facility is leased through July 2012. We will continue to use a portion of the facility for certain administrative functions for an indeterminable amount of time and will sublease the facility to the Buyer for twelve to seventeen months. If we or the Buyer cease using the facility before the expiration of the lease term, we may be required to recognize a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease through March 2012. <br><br>Management&#x2019;s estimates of costs and charges relating to the sale of our Reconstructive Division assets are preliminary and based on a number of significant assumptions. The estimated amounts conce
rning the anticipated costs and charges constitute forward-looking statements and are based on management&#x2019;s expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting Cardo. The actual costs and charges resulting from the disposition of the Reconstructive Division assets may materially differ from what has been estimated at this time. <br><br>We will file amendments to this Form 8-K, as necessary, or make additional disclosures in our other periodic reports that we file with the SEC, upon the determination of any further material cash or non-cash charges, individually or in the aggregate, or of any material changes to our estimates of such amounts, to be incurred in connection with the disposal of our Reconstructive Division assets. <br><br>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS <br>This filing contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), regarding the benefits of the asset sale transaction, whether the satisfaction of the clos
ing conditions will be met and the asset sale consummated, and Cardo's plans post-transaction. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the ability of the companies to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the asset sale and to consummate the asset sale transaction; and unanticipated events that could impact the value of the Sellers' inventory, property plant and equipment relating to the Reconstructive Division and/or the royalty payments and as a result impact the closing consideration. In addition, forward-looking statements also may be adversely affected by general market factors, federal and state regulations and legislation, patent positions and litigation, among other factors. Cardo's forward looking statements speak only as the date of this filing or when made and Cardo does not undertake to update or revise the
 forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the PSLRA.<br><br>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">This <B>ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT </B>(&#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is entered into as of January&nbsp;24, 2011, by
and among <B>Cardo Medical, Inc.</B>, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Cardo Medical</U>&#148;), <B>Cardo Medical,
LLC</B>, a Delaware limited liability company (together with Cardo Medical, &#147;<U>Sellers</U>&#148; and each
a &#147;<U>Seller</U>&#148;) and <B>Arthrex, Inc.</B>, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Buyer</U>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U><B>RECITALS</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Sellers own and operate an orthopedic medical device company specializing designing,
developing and marketing reconstructive joint devices (as such business is conducted by Sellers as
of the date hereof, the &#147;<U>Business</U>&#148;). Buyer desires to purchase and Sellers desire to sell
the Purchased Assets (as hereinafter defined), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings set forth in
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U>. In consideration of the mutual representations and agreements herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U><B>TERMS OF AGREEMENT</B></U><BR>
<B>ARTICLE I</B><BR>
<U><B>PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS; ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>1.1 </B><U><B>Purchased Assets</B></U><B>. </B>At the Closing, each Seller agrees to sell, convey, transfer,
assign and deliver to Buyer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all
Liens, except for Permitted Liens.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>1.2 </B><U><B>Excluded Assets</B></U><B>. </B>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
<U>Section&nbsp;1.1</U> or elsewhere herein, the Purchased Assets shall exclude all Excluded Assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>1.3 </B><U><B>Asset Transfer</B></U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;At the Closing, the Sellers shall transfer all right, title and interest in and to all of
the Purchased Assets to Buyer, and Sellers shall deliver to Buyer possession of all of the
Purchased Assets. Sellers shall further deliver to Buyer proper assignments, conveyances and bills
of sale sufficient to convey to Buyer good and valid title to all the Purchased Assets free and
clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens, as well as such other instruments of conveyance
necessary to effect or evidence the transfers contemplated hereby.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;To the extent that any of the Purchased Assets or any claim, right or benefit arising
under or resulting from such Purchased Assets (collectively, the &#147;<U>Rights</U>&#148;) is not capable
of being transferred without the approval, consent or waiver of any third person, or if the
transfer of a Right would constitute a breach of any obligation under, or violation of, any
applicable Law unless the approval, consent or waiver of such third person is obtained, then,
except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement and without limiting the rights and
remedies of Buyer contained elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to transfer such Right unless and until such approval, consent or waiver has been
obtained. After the Closing Date and until all such Rights are transferred to Buyer, each Seller
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to: assist Buyer in obtaining such approvals,
consents and waivers with respect to all Rights not so transferred; maintain such Seller&#146;s
existence and hold the Rights in trust for Buyer; comply with the terms and provisions of the
Rights as agent for Buyer for Buyer&#146;s benefit; cooperate with Buyer in any commercially reasonable
and lawful arrangements designed to provide the benefits of such Rights solely and exclusively to
Buyer; and not waive, alter or amend any obligations of third parties with respect to such Rights
not so transferred, whether expressly or impliedly without the written consent of Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Buyer shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to designate additional Contracts as Purchased Assets, excluding Contracts that are
Spinal Assets or used exclusively in either Seller&#146;s business related to the Spinal Assets. Upon
such designation, <U>Schedule&nbsp;1.2(i)</U> shall be updated accordingly.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>1.4 </B><U><B>Assumed Liabilities</B></U><B>. </B>At the Closing, Buyer agrees to assume, pay, discharge and
perform when required and lawfully due, only the Assumed Liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>1.5 </B><U><B>Excluded Liabilities</B></U><B>. </B>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall not assume or otherwise become liable for
any Excluded Liabilities. Each of the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and successors and assigns (each, an &#147;<U>Indemnified
Party</U>&#148;), from and against any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses (including court costs,
amounts paid in settlement, judgments, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees or other expenses for
investigating and defending), suits, actions, claims, deficiencies, liabilities or obligations
(&#147;<U>Losses</U>&#148;) related to, caused by or arising from any of the Excluded Liabilities. Any such
indemnification shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;10.13, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein. The fact that a particular matter or circumstance does
or does not, or may or may not, constitute a breach by the Sellers of their representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement shall not have any relevance to the determination of whether
any liability or obligation related thereto is, or is not, an Excluded Liability. Furthermore,
disclosure of a liability or potential liability to Buyer in the Disclosure Schedules hereto or
otherwise shall not have any relevance to the determination of whether any liability or obligation
is, or is not, an Excluded Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section
10.13(c), in the event Buyer determines that it is reasonably necessary to satisfy an Excluded
Liability in order to obtain products or services from any supplier to the Business, Buyer shall
have the right, after reasonable consultation with Sellers, to satisfy such Excluded Liability
without prejudice to its rights under this Section&nbsp;1.5.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE II</B><BR>
<U><B>PURCHASE PRICE</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>2.1 </B><U><B>Purchase Price</B></U>. The consideration for the Purchased Assets being acquired by
Buyer hereunder shall be (i)&nbsp;the assumption by Buyer of Assumed Liabilities, (ii)&nbsp;the payment of
the Royalty (as hereafter defined) to Cardo Medical and (iii)&nbsp;the Cash Consideration, payable to
Cardo Medical on behalf of both Sellers, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.5
(collectively, &#147;<U>Purchase Price</U>&#148;). For purposes of this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Cash
Consideration</U>&#148; shall mean (i)&nbsp;Nine Million Nine Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($9,960,000)
<U>plus</U> (ii)&nbsp;the Closing Asset Value. As of the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
$250,000 deposit to be credited against the Cash Consideration at Closing (the &#147;<U>Deposit</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>2.2 </B><U><B>Royalty</B></U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;As partial consideration for the purchase of the Purchased Assets hereunder, Buyer shall
pay Cardo Medical an amount (the &#147;<U>Royalty</U>&#148;) equal to 5&nbsp;percent (5%) of Net Sales of (i)&nbsp;the
products identified on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.2</U> hereof and (ii)&nbsp;any successor products thereto or any
improvements, alterations or derivations thereof, in each case of any such successor products,
improvements, alterations or derivations that (A)&nbsp;utilize any patents, patent applications, or
provisional patents included in the Purchased Assets or (B)&nbsp;utilize, to a material extent, any
inventions, trade secrets, or other confidential or proprietary information, including design
drawings or product descriptions (whether or not such drawings, descriptions or information remain
confidential or proprietary following the Closing) (but not solely trademarks or trade names)
included in the Purchased Assets (collectively, the &#147;<U>Subject Products</U>&#148;), in cash on a
quarterly basis, for a period up to and including the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Closing
(the &#147;<U>Royalty Term</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subject Products shall not
include any products developed by or on behalf of Buyer without use of any of the Purchased Assets.
Such quarterly royalty payments shall be due forty-five (45)&nbsp;days following the end of each
calendar quarter or the end of the Term, as applicable. As used herein, &#147;<U>Net Sales</U>&#148; means
the consolidated net sales of Buyer and its subsidiaries (including any licensing fees and/or
royalties) attributable to the Subject Products less commissions, returns, customer allowances and
rebates, collection losses and customer discounts attributable to the Subject Products, in each
case determined in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. Buyer shall provide
reasonable documentation supporting the calculation of the Royalty hereunder, including a quarterly
report providing reasonable detail of Net Sales and the calculation of the Royalty for such quarter
that shall accompany each payment hereunder. Upon at least five (5)&nbsp;days prior written notice,
Buyer shall also grant Cardo Medical reasonable access to its books and records to verify such
calculation subject to a customary confidentiality agreement. In the event of a sale, transfer or
other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by merger, asset sale, equity sale,
consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) by Buyer of the right to sell or manufacture any of the
Subject Products to a third party purchaser (an &#147;<U>Asset Purchaser</U>&#148;) in one transaction or
series of related transactions (an &#147;<U>Asset Sale Transaction</U>&#148;), Buyer (or such successor or
assign) shall cause any such Asset Purchaser to assume the obligations of Buyer (or such successor
or assign) set forth in this Section&nbsp;2.2 with respect to the Subject Products (or rights relating
thereto) directly or indirectly transferred in connection with such Asset Sale Transaction (which
shall include all Subject Products in the event of an Asset Sale Transaction that is a merger of
Buyer or a sale of a controlling interest in its equity). Buyer shall provide Sellers with at
least ten (10)&nbsp;days written notice of any Asset Sale Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Buyer shall have a right to set-off against the payment of the Royalty due to Cardo
Medical hereunder solely to the extent of any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
amounts paid in settlement and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in good faith after
consultation with counsel and paid by Buyer, arising out of claims by unaffiliated third parties
alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, patents,
trade secrets, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, by any Subject Product to the
extent based on Intangible Property contained in the Purchased Assets (&#147;<U>Infringement
Claims</U>&#148;). In no event shall Buyer have any other right of set-off against any amounts due to
any Seller or its Affiliates hereunder. Neither the exercise nor the failure to exercise such
right of set off will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.5 hereof. If
it is ultimately determined that such amounts were not due to Buyer, then any Royalty to which
Buyer exercised its right of set-off under this Section&nbsp;2.2 shall be paid to Cardo Medical and
shall bear interest from (i)&nbsp;the date such Royalty was payable pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.2 until
(ii)&nbsp;the date on which such Royalty is paid by Buyer to Cardo Medical, at a rate equal to 8% per
annum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Until such time as the Royalty has achieved a Net Present Value of $3,000,000, Buyer
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote the sale of Subject Products during the
Royalty Term; <U>provided</U> that &#147;commercially reasonable efforts&#148; shall mean efforts and
resources consistent with those used by Buyer and its subsidiaries in promoting their other
products of a similar stage of product life and of similar market potential, taking into account
the competitiveness of the Subject Products and alternative products, the profitability of the
Subject Products and alternative products, and other factors deemed relevant by Buyer in exercising
its business judgment. Sellers understand and acknowledge that control of all business decisions
concerning the Business and the Subject Products (including, without limitation, sales and
marketing, capital expenditures, product pricing, employee hiring and retention, subcontracting
authority, facilities and employee management and acquisitions or dispositions of assets (and the
timing thereof)), from and after the Closing Date shall be the absolute right of the Buyer, and
that Buyer may operate its business and the business of its subsidiaries (including Buyer) in the
manner it deems appropriate in its sole discretion. In no event shall Sellers have any claim
regarding Buyer&#146;s failure to use commercially reasonable efforts if the Royalty has achieved a Net
Present Value of $3,000,000. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U>Net Present Value</U>&#148; means the
aggregate present value of the Royalty payments received, with each payment discounted from the
date of payment to the Closing Date using a discount rate of 8% per annum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>2.3 </B><U><B>Allocation of Purchase Price; Tax Treatment</B></U>. The Purchase Price will be allocated
among the Sellers and among the Purchased Assets consistent with the allocation set forth on a
schedule to be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto prior to the Closing (the &#147;<U>Allocation
Schedule</U>&#148;). The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance
with Section&nbsp;1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Buyer and Sellers each agree to file
Internal Revenue Service Form&nbsp;8594, and all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns, in
accordance with the Allocation Schedule; and in that event, Buyer and Sellers each agree to provide
the other promptly with any other information reasonably required to complete Form&nbsp;8594. The
parties hereto intend that the transaction contemplated hereby be treated for tax purposes as
taxable under Section&nbsp;1001 of the Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>2.4 </B><U><B>Escrow Account</B></U><B>. </B>At the Closing, Buyer shall withhold Nine Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($900,000) (the &#147;<U>Escrow Amount</U>&#148;) from the Purchase Price and shall deposit the
Escrow Amount for a period of 12&nbsp;months pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in the form attached
hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> (the &#147;<U>Escrow Agreement</U>&#148;). The funds held pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement shall be available (a)&nbsp;to fund the amount of any adjustment pursuant to Section
2.5(c) hereunder and (b)&nbsp;to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.5 or Section&nbsp;6.3.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>2.5 </B><U><B>Adjustment of Purchase Price</B></U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Estimated Closing Asset Value Statement</U>. At least two (2)&nbsp;Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Sellers and Buyer shall agree upon a written statement (the &#147;<U>Estimated
Closing Asset Value Statement</U>&#148;) setting forth in reasonable detail its good faith estimate of
(i)&nbsp;the Closing Asset Value as of the Closing (the &#147;<U>Estimated Closing Asset Value</U>&#148;) and
(ii)&nbsp;based on such amount, the estimated Cash Consideration (&#147;<U>Estimated Cash
Consideration</U>&#148;). The Estimated Closing Asset Value Statement will be prepared in accordance
with GAAP (with respect to each item included within Closing Asset Value). With respect to
Property, Plant and Equipment, Sellers and Buyer have agreed that the Closing Asset Value will be
the net book value of such assets as of the Closing, prepared in accordance with GAAP. With
respect to Inventory, Sellers and Buyer have agreed that the Closing Asset Value will be the gross
cost value of the saleable and non-obsolete finished goods inventory, work in process and packaging
material of the Business as of the Closing, without inclusion of a reserve for slow moving
inventory.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Closing Asset Value Statement</U>. Within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the Closing Date,
Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared, and will provide to Sellers, a written statement (the
&#147;<U>Closing Asset Value Statement</U>&#148;) setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of
the Closing Asset Value as of the Closing. The Closing Asset Value Statement will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP (with respect to each item included within Closing Asset Value), and shall be
consistent with the methodology used in the calculation of the Estimated Cash Consideration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Dispute Notice</U>. The Closing Asset Value Statement (and the calculation of the
Closing Asset Value contained therein) will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties unless
Sellers provides a written notice (a &#147;<U>Dispute Notice</U>&#148;) to Buyer no later than thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Closing Asset Value Statement setting forth in reasonable detail (i)&nbsp;any
item Sellers dispute on the Closing Asset Value Statement (each, a &#147;<U>Disputed Item</U>&#148;) and
(ii)&nbsp;the correct amount of such item in accordance with GAAP. Any item or amount to which no
dispute is raised in the Dispute Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Resolution of Disputes</U>. If the Sellers have delivered the Dispute Notice within
the 30-day period, then Buyer and Sellers will attempt to resolve each Disputed Item. In the event
all such Disputed Items are not resolved within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice, either Buyer or Sellers may provide written notice to the other that it elects to
submit the Disputed Items to an accounting firm of national or regional recognition mutually agreed
upon by the parties (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). If the parties cannot so agree, each of Buyer
and Cardo Medical shall select an accounting firm of national or regional recognition and such two
accounting firms shall select a third accounting firm of national or regional recognition to serve
as the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm will promptly review Disputed Items submitted to it
for resolution and objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each
such Disputed Item in accordance with GAAP. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
paid by the Party whose estimate of the Disputed Items, in the aggregate, is furthest from the
final determination of such Disputed Items, in the aggregate, by the Accounting Firm; otherwise
such fees and expenses shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers. The decision of the
Accounting Firm with respect to the Disputed Item(s) submitted to it (and the determination of the
Closing Asset Value resulting therefrom) will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Each
of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Accounting
Firm and to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all Disputed Items no later than thirty (30)
Business Days after submission of the dispute to the Accounting Firm.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Adjustment Payment</U>. No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after final
determination of the Closing Asset Value in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.5:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;if the Closing Asset Value as finally determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.5 exceeds the
Estimated Closing Asset Value, then Buyer will pay to the Sellers such excess by wire transfer of
immediately available funds; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;if the Closing Asset Value as finally determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.5 is less
than the Estimated Closing Asset Value, then an amount equal to such shortfall will be paid by the
Sellers to Buyer from the Escrow Account, and the Sellers shall promptly execute a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release such amount from the Escrow Account.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE III</B><BR>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<B>Third-Party Claims. </B>If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding, other than an Infringement
Claim, made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (a &#147;<U>Third-Party
Claim</U>&#148;) against such Indemnified Party with respect to which Sellers (the &#147;<U>Indemnifying
Parties</U>&#148;) are subject to indemnification under Section&nbsp;1.5, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Parties of their indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties forfeit rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all documents received with respect thereto, and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the damages that have been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate
in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim at the Indemnifying Parties&#146; expense and by counsel selected by the Indemnifying Parties that
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
good faith in such defense; provided, that the Indemnifying Parties shall only have the right to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim if (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party in writing within 15&nbsp;days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
entirety of any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating
to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third-Party Claim, (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party will have the financial resources to defend against the Third-Party Claim and
fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii)&nbsp;the Third-Party Claim involves only money
damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, and (iv)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently. In the event that the
Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section&nbsp;10.13(b), they
shall have the right to take such action as they deem necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal
or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Parties&#146; right to control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Parties (A)&nbsp;elect
not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim, (B)&nbsp;fail to promptly notify the Indemnified
Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement or (C)&nbsp;fails to actively
and diligent conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section&nbsp;10.13(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. Sellers and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<B>Settlement of Third-Party Claims. </B>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Indemnifying Parties shall not enter into settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except to the extent that the settlement offer (a)&nbsp;does not result in any liability or
the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and (b)
provides, in customary form, for the complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from all claims, liabilities and obligations of any kind or nature arising out of, or related to,
the events, facts, conditions or circumstances underlying such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.13(a), it shall not agree to any
settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<B>Direct Claims. </B>Any claim by an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.5 that does not
result from a Third-Party Claim (a &#147;<U>Direct Claim</U>&#148;) shall be asserted by the Indemnified
Party giving the Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Parties of their indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the damages that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Parties shall have twenty (20)&nbsp;days after
their receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Parties do not so respond within such twenty (20)-day period, the Indemnifying Parties shall be
deemed to have accepted responsibility for such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be
free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party to enforce such
responsibility on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOW THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth,
the Parties and the Escrow Agent agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;<B>Appointment</B>. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes
set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and
conditions set forth herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">2.&nbsp;<B>Fund. </B>Purchaser agrees to deposit with the Escrow Agent the sum of $1,000,000 (the &#147;Escrow
Deposit&#148;). The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Deposit and, subject to the terms and conditions

the Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the
investment of moneys held in the Fund or the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any
investment described herein. The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained
as a result of any investment in an investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a
result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the Parties
to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have
the right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required
payments under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">4.&nbsp;<B>Disposition and Termination. </B>(a)&nbsp;From time to time on or before &#091;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&#093;, 2012,
Purchaser may give a written notice (a &#147;<U>Notice</U>&#148;) to Seller and Escrow Agent of (i)&nbsp;a claim
relating to an adjustment to the purchase price based upon the Closing Asset Value (a &#147;<U>Purchase
Price Adjustment Claim</U>&#148;) or (ii)&nbsp;any claim in accordance with the terms of Section&nbsp;1.5 of the
Asset Purchase Agreement (a &#147;<U>General Claim</U>&#148;). The Notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature of the Purchase Price Adjustment Claim or the General Claim, as the case may be,
and the amount claimed from the Fund. If Seller gives notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent
disputing such Purchase Price Adjustment Claim or General Claim, as the case may be (a &#147;<U>Counter
Notice</U>&#148;), by no later than 5:00PM, New York time on the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) day following
receipt by Escrow Agent and Seller of the Notice regarding said Purchase Price Adjustment Claim or
General Claim, such Purchase Price Adjustment Claim or General Claim shall be resolved as provided
in Section 4(b) below. If no Counter Notice is received by Escrow Agent within such 10-day period,
then on the Business Day following the end of such 10-day period, Escrow Agent shall pay to
Purchaser the dollar amount claimed in the Notice, up to the amount of the Fund that remains in
escrow pursuant to this Agreement at such time. Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider
whether the subject Purchase Price Adjustment Claim or General Claim complies with the requirements
of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Each Notice from the Purchaser shall state that it is a Purchase
Price Adjustment Claim or General Claim delivered pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;If a Counter Notice is given with respect to a claim, Escrow Agent shall make payment with
respect thereto only in accordance with (i)&nbsp;joint written instructions of Purchaser and Seller
indicating that the Parties have reached an agreement with respect to the release of the Fund and
setting forth the terms upon which such funds must be released, (ii)&nbsp;the report of the Accounting
Firm, in the case of a Purchase Price Adjustment Claim, delivered along with joint instructions
from the Purchaser and Seller, or (iii)&nbsp;a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction stipulating the terms upon which such funds must be released, along with a
certification from the prevailing party stating that the court order is final and non-appealable
(such delivery in item (b)(i), (b)(ii) or (b)(iii), the &#147;Release Instructions&#148;). Escrow Agent
shall thereafter pay to Purchaser and/or Seller (on behalf of itself and Cardo Medical, LLC), as
the case may be, any dollar amounts due to it in accordance with the Release Instructions, up to
the amount of the Fund that remains in escrow pursuant to this Agreement at such time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(c)&nbsp;On &#091;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&#093;, 2012, Escrow Agent shall pay and distribute to Seller (on behalf of itself
and Cardo Medical, LLC) an amount equal to the excess of the then remaining Fund over the aggregate
dollar amount of (i)&nbsp;any then outstanding Purchase Price Adjustment Claim or General Claim for
which a Notice was delivered by Purchaser on or prior to &#091;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&#093;, 2012 plus (ii)&nbsp;any
amounts that remain unsatisfied pursuant to pending Release Instructions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(d)&nbsp;Upon delivery of the Fund by the Escrow Agent, this Agreement shall terminate, subject to the
provisions of Section&nbsp;8(b).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">5.&nbsp;<B>Escrow Agent</B>. (a)&nbsp;The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and
expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties
shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with,
knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including
without limitation the Asset Purchase Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to
determine if any person or entity has complied with any Asset Purchase Agreement, nor shall any
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of any Asset Purchase
Agreement, even though reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. In the event of any
conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement, those of the Asset Purchase Agreement<B>,</B>
any schedule or exhibit attached to this Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties, the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not
be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or
request furnished to it hereunder and reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper Party or Parties without inquiry and without requiring
substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party, any
beneficiary or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth,
claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund, or any
portion thereof, unless such instruction shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with Section&nbsp;11 below and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable
security procedures as may be required thereunder. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to
inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice,
instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be
due it or the Fund, including, without limitation, the Escrow Deposit nor shall the Escrow Agent
have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts
deposited with it hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by
it in good faith except to the extent that a final adjudication of a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the
primary cause of any loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and
perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents. The Escrow Agent may
consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
accordance with, or in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or
other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is
some ambiguity as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or
demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this
Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be
to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be given a direction in writing by the
Parties which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent or by a
final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree
to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute without making the Escrow Agent a
party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall
the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent
has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">6.&nbsp;<B>Succession. </B>(a)&nbsp;The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations
hereunder by giving thirty (30)&nbsp;days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the Parties
specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30)&nbsp;days following receipt of the notice
of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties hereto. Escrow Agent&#146;s sole responsibility
after such thirty (30)&nbsp;day notice period expires shall be to hold the Fund (without any obligation
to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, or
in accordance with the directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, at which time of delivery Escrow Agent&#146;s obligations hereunder shall cease and
terminate, subject to the provisions of Sections&nbsp;7 and<U> </U>8 hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all the escrow business may be
transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">7.&nbsp;<B>Compensation and Reimbursement. </B>The Parties agree jointly and severally (a)&nbsp;to pay the Escrow
Agent upon execution of this Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable compensation for
the services to be rendered hereunder, along with any fees or charges for accounts, including those
levied by any governmental authority which the Escrow Agent may impose, charge or pass-through,
which, in each case, unless otherwise agreed in writing, shall be as described in Schedule&nbsp;2
attached hereto, and (b)&nbsp;to pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for all expenses,
disbursements and advances, including, without limitation reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and expenses,
incurred or made by it in connection with the performance, modification and termination of this
Agreement. The obligations set forth in this Section&nbsp;7 shall survive the resignation, replacement
or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. Such compensation, fees,
charges, expenses, disbursements, and advances payable to the Escrow Agent shall be borne 50% by
Purchaser and 50% by Seller.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">8.&nbsp;<B>Indemnity. </B>The Parties shall jointly and severally, , indemnify, defend and save harmless the
Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, agents and employees (the
&#147;Indemnitees&#148;) from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties,
judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including, without
limitation, the fees and expenses of outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment)(collectively &#147;Losses&#148;), arising out of or in
connection with (i)&nbsp;the Escrow Agent&#146;s execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting
or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this
Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the Indemnitee, except in the
case of any Indemnitee to the extent that such Losses are finally adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee, or (ii)&nbsp;its following any instructions or other directions, whether joint or
singular, from the Parties, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or
direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The indemnity obligations set forth in this
Section&nbsp;8 shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">9.&nbsp;<B>Patriot Act Disclosure/Taxpayer Identification Numbers/Tax Reporting.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(a)&nbsp;<B>Patriot Act Disclosure. </B>Section&nbsp;326 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;)
requires the Escrow Agent to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person
that opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that Section&nbsp;326 of the USA
PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agent&#146;s identity verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to
obtain information which may be used to confirm the Parties&#146; identities including without
limitation name, address and organizational documents (&#147;identifying information&#148;). The Parties
agree to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties
any such identifying information required as a condition of opening an account with or using any
service provided by the Escrow Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;<B>Certification and Tax Reporting. </B>The Parties have provided the Escrow Agent with their
respective fully executed Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) Form W-8, or W-9 and/or other required
documentation. All interest or other income earned under this Agreement shall be allocated to the
Seller and reported, as and to the extent required by law, by the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any
other taxing authority, on IRS Form&nbsp;1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from
the Escrow by the Seller whether or not said income has been distributed during such year. Escrow
Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the absence of proper tax documentation or
as required by law, and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Parties hereby
represent and warrant to the Escrow Agent that (i)&nbsp;there is no sale or transfer of an United States
Real Property Interest as defined under IRC Section 897(c) in the underlying transaction giving
rise to this Agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;such underlying transaction does not constitute an installment
sale requiring any tax reporting or withholding of imputed interest or original issue discount to
the IRS or other taxing authority.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">10.&nbsp;<B>Notices. </B>All communications hereunder shall be in writing and except for communications from
the Parties setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the

communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date received by an officer of the Escrow
Agent or any employee of the Escrow Agent who reports directly to any such officer at the
above-referenced office. In the event that the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, shall
determine that an emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use such other means of communication as
the Escrow Agent deems appropriate. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Business Day&#148; shall mean any

address set forth above is authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.

instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the
transfer or distribution of funds, including but not limited to any such funds transfer
instructions that may otherwise be set forth in a written instruction permitted pursuant to Section
4 of this Agreement, may be given to the Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile and no
instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Fund, or any portion thereof,
shall be deemed delivered and effective unless the Escrow Agent actually shall have received such
instruction by facsimile at the number provided to the Parties by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with Section&nbsp;10 and as further evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to that number.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(a)&nbsp;In the event funds transfer instructions are received by the Escrow Agent by facsimile, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the
person or persons designated on Schedule&nbsp;1 hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and
telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and
acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized
representatives identified in Schedule&nbsp;1, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized both to receive
written instructions from and seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any
one or more of Seller&#146;s or Purchaser&#146;s executive officers, (&#147;Executive Officers&#148;), as the case may
be, which shall include the titles of President, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Treasurer
or Chief Financial Officer or Chief Legal Officer, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such &#147;Executive
Officer&#148; shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and the Escrow
Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent
and the beneficiary&#146;s bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or
similar identifying numbers provided by Seller or Purchaser to identify (i)&nbsp;the beneficiary, (ii)
the beneficiary&#146;s bank, or (iii)&nbsp;an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the Fund
for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result
in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than
the beneficiary&#146;s bank or an intermediary bank designated.

covenants contained herein to be reasonable for the protection of Company, if any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section&nbsp;2 are found by a court to be unreasonable because they are
overly broad as to time period, geographic area or otherwise, then and in that case such
restriction shall nevertheless remain effective but shall be considered amended in such manner so
as to make the restriction reasonable in scope as determined by such court and shall be in force as
amended.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>THIS SUB-SUBLEASE AGREEMENT </B>(this &#147;<U>Sub-Sublease</U>&#148;) is entered into as of <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>,
2011 (the &#147;<U>Effective Date</U>&#148;), by and between <B>CARDO MEDICAL, INC. </B>(&#147;<U>Sub-Sublessor</U>&#148;),
and &#091; &#093; (&#147;<U>Sub-Sublessee</U>&#148;, and together with Sub-Sublessor, the &#147;<U>Parties</U>&#148;, and each
a &#147;<U>Party</U>&#148;), with reference to the hereinafter described premises which Sub-Sublessor has
subleased from 10 CLIFTON ASSOCIATES, LLC (&#147;<U>Owner</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">The Parties do hereby agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Master Lease</U>. Sub-Sublessor is the subtenant of certain premises known as Unit B1
currently containing approximately 10,081 net rentable square feet (the &#147;<U>Premises</U>&#148;) located
in the Building referred to in the Master Lease (as hereinafter defined) which is located at 10
Clifton Boulevard, Clifton, New Jersey. Owner, as lessor, and Polymer Technologies, Inc.
(&#147;<U>PTI</U>&#148;), as lessee, entered into that certain Lease Agreement dated February&nbsp;6, 2003, as
amended by that certain Lease Extension Agreement dated as of August&nbsp;31, 2009 (together, the
&#147;<U>PTI Lease</U>&#148;) pursuant to which PTI leased the entire Building from Owner. Concurrently
therewith, PTI, as sublandlord, and Owner, as subtenant, entered into that certain Sublease (Back
Building) dated February&nbsp;6, 2003 (the &#147;<U>Clifton Sublease</U>&#148;) pursuant to which Owner subleased
approximately 30,000 square feet in the Building as more particularly described therein (the
&#147;<U>Clifton Premises</U>&#148;). Owner subsequently subleased the Premises, which constitute a portion
of the Clifton Premises, to Sub-Sublessor pursuant to that certain Modified Net Lease dated as of
July&nbsp;8, 2009 by and between Owner and Sub-Sublessor, as amended by that certain Amendment to
Modified Net Lease dated as of <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 2009 by and between Owner and Sub-Sublessor (together,
the &#147;<U>Master Lease</U>&#148;). Sub-Sublessee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Master
Lease, the PTI Lease and the Clifton Sublease (collectively, the &#147;<U>Master Lease Documents</U>&#148;),
copies of which are attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U>. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Master Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Terms of Sub-Sublease and Sub-Sublessor&#146;s Covenants</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">(a)&nbsp;Sub-Sublessor does hereby sublease to Sub-Sublessee, and Sub-Sublessee does hereby sublease,
take and hire from Sub-Sublessor, the Premises, including its allocable share of the Common
Facilities and the Parking Spaces and excluding the office space, cube area and the storage area
depicted on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> attached hereto consisting of approximately 1,512.15 rentable square
feet (the &#147;<U>Excluded Premises</U>&#148;). Except as explicitly excluded in Section&nbsp;4 of this
Sub-Sublease and to the extent inapplicable to this Sub-Sublease, Sub-Sublessee shall be subject
to, bound by and comply with all terms, conditions, covenants and provisions of the Master Lease
Documents and shall satisfy all obligations under the Master Lease Documents relating to the
Premises for the benefit of Sub-Sublessor, Owner and PTI from and after the Effective Date.
Wherever in this Sub-Sublease the word &#147;Premises&#148; appears, it shall mean the Premises less the
Excluded Premises. Wherever in the Master Lease or the PTI Lease the word &#147;Lessee&#148; appears, for
the purposes of this Sub-Sublease, the word &#147;Sub-Sublessee&#148; shall be substituted therefor, and
wherever the word &#147;Lessor&#148; appears, for the purposes of this Sub-Sublease, the word &#147;Sub-Sublessor&#148;
shall be substituted therefore. Wherever in the Clifton Sublease the word &#147;Sublessee&#148; appears, for
the purposes of this Sub-Sublease, the word &#147;Sub-Sublessee&#148; shall be substituted therefor, and
wherever the word, &#147;Sublessor&#148; appears, for the purposes of this Sub-Sublease, the word
&#147;Sub-Sublessor&#148; shall be substituted therefore. Upon the breach of any of said terms, conditions,
covenants or provisions of the Master Lease Documents by either Party or upon the failure of
Sub-Sublessee to pay Rent (as hereinafter defined) hereunder or comply with any of the provisions
of this Sub-Sublease, either Party may exercise any and all rights and remedies granted to such
Party by the Master Lease Documents or this Sub-Sublease. In the event of any conflict between
this Sub-Sublease and the Master Lease Documents, the terms of this Sub-Sublease shall control. In
the event of any conflict between the Master Lease and the PTI Lease or the Clifton Sublease, the
terms of the Master Lease shall control.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">(b)&nbsp;Sub-Sublessor agrees to accord to Sub-Sublessee the same services and benefits with respect to
the Premises that Sub-Sublessor is accorded (to the extent that Sub-Sublessor receives such
benefits from Owner or PTI) under the Master Lease Documents. Sublessor shall not otherwise be
obligated to provide Sublessee with any services or benefits. Any notice required under the Master
Lease relating to such benefits to be given by Sub-Sublessor to Sub-Sublessee shall be given
immediately after Sub-Sublessor receives such notice under the Master Lease Documents. All
representations and warranties of Owner or PTI under the Master Lease Documents shall apply to the
Premises under this Sub-Sublease and be deemed to be for the direct benefit of Sub-Sublessee, and
Sub-Sublessor hereby acknowledges that the applicability of such representations and warranties is
a material inducement to Sub-Sublessee for entering into this Sub-Sublease; provided, however, that
nothing in the foregoing shall impute any responsibility on Sub-Sublessor for any representations
and warranties given by the Owner or PTI and no such representations and warranties shall be deemed
to have been given by Sub-Sublessor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">(c)&nbsp;Provided Sub-Sublessee shall not be in default under this Sub-Sublease beyond any applicable
notice and cure periods, Sub-Sublessor warrants during the term of this Sub-Sublease that
Sub-Sublessee shall hold, enjoy and possess the Premises free from hindrance by Sub-Sublessor or
any other person claiming by, through or under Sub-Sublessor. Except to the extent caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Sub-Sublessee, Sub-Sublessor shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sub-Sublessee against and from any and all claims, demands, costs, suits, liabilities and
damages asserted against Sub-Sublessee by virtue of Sub-Sublessor&#146;s failure to perform any
obligation of Sub-Sublessor under this Sub-Sublease or the Master Lease Documents. Sub-Sublessor
agrees not to further encumber its interest in the Premises without Sub-Sublessee&#146;s prior written
consent. Except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Sub-Sublessor, Sub-Sublessee shall indemnify and hold harmless Sub-Sublessor against and from any
and all claims, demands, costs, suits, liabilities and damages asserted against Sub-Sublessor by
virtue of Sub-Sublessee&#146;s failure to perform any obligation of Sub-Sublessee under this
Sub-Sublease or the Master Lease Documents. Sub-Sublessee agrees not to encumber its interest in
the Premises without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Sub-Sublessor or any other
party as required under the Master Lease Documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">(d)&nbsp;Sub-Sublessor covenants and agrees that it (i)&nbsp;shall neither voluntarily terminate any of the
Master Lease Documents nor cause any of the Master Lease Documents to be terminated due to an event
of default for which Sub-Sublessor is responsible or over which it has control, (ii)&nbsp;shall
completely and timely perform or observe all terms, covenants, provisions, undertakings and
conditions of the Master Lease Documents specifically applicable to Sub-Sublessor thereunder and
hereunder, in accordance with their terms and (iii)&nbsp;shall provide Sub-Sublessee, via overnight
delivery, with a copy of any notice received from or sent to Owner and/or PTI. Sub-Sublessee
covenants and agrees that it (i)&nbsp;shall not cause any of the Master Lease Documents to be terminated
due to an event of default for which Sub-Sublessee is responsible or over which it has control,
(ii)&nbsp;shall completely and timely perform or observe all terms, covenants, provisions, undertakings
and conditions of the Master Lease Documents specifically applicable to Sub-Sublessee pursuant
hereto, in accordance with their terms and (iii)&nbsp;shall provide Sub-Sublessor, via overnight
delivery, with a copy of any notice received from or sent to Owner and/or PTI.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Inapplicable Paragraphs</U>. Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein, the
provisions of the following Sections of the Master Lease are inapplicable to the rights and
obligations of Sub-Sublessor and Sub-Sublessee to each other under this Sub-Sublease: Basic Lease
Provisions (2), (4), (12), (13), (14)&nbsp;and Sections&nbsp;2, 3, 14, 18, 19, 24(A), 34, 37, 44, 45 and 46.
Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein, the provisions of the following Sections of the
Clifton Sublease are inapplicable to the rights and obligations of Sub-Sublessor and Sub-Sublessee
to each other under this Sub-Sublease: Sections&nbsp;2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12(B), 12(C), 12(D), 22
and 23. The provisions of the following Sections of the PTI Lease are inapplicable to the rights
and obligations of Sub-Sublessor and Sub-Sublessee to each other under this Sub-Sublease: Basic
Lease Provisions (4)&nbsp;through and including (15)&nbsp;and Sections&nbsp;2, 3, 4, 5, 6(A), 17, 26, 27, 35, 36,
44, 47 and 48.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Term</U>. The term of this Sub-Sublease (the &#147;<U>Term</U>&#148;) shall commence on the
Effective Date and end on <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>, 2012 (the &#147;<U>Initial Expiration Date</U>&#148;).
Sub-Sublessor hereby grants Sub-Sublessee the option to extend the expiration date of the Term to
October&nbsp;31, 2012 such that it shall coincide with the expiration of the Master Lease.
Sub-Sublessee may exercise its option to so extend the Term by delivering written notice thereof to
Sub-Sublessor no later than forty-five (45)&nbsp;days prior to the Initial Expiration Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Permitted Use</U>. Sub-Sublessee shall use and occupy the Premises solely for the
purposes permitted by the Master Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Rent</U>. Sub-Sublessee shall pay to Sub-Sublessor at the address for notices specified
below or at such other place as Sub-Sublessor may designate in writing, in advance, on the first
(1st) day of each calendar month during the Term hereof, all amounts due from Sub-Sublessee to
Sub-Sublessor, including, without limitation, Monthly Installments of Fixed Basic Rent and
Additional Rent (including, but not limited to, any amounts due pursuant to Sections&nbsp;19 and 44 of
the Master Lease) due under the Master Lease, less the Excluded Premises Credit (as hereinafter
defined) (collectively, the &#147;<U>Rent</U>&#148;). Rent shall be paid without abatement, deduction,
claim, offset, prior notice or demand. Sub-Sublessee shall pay Sub-Sublessor the first installment
of Rent upon Sub-Sublessee&#146;s execution of this Sub-Sublease. Rent for any period during the Term
hereof which is for less than one month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly installment.
Sub-Sublessor shall continue to pay to Owner all amounts due under the Master Lease, including, but
not limited to, Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent. For purposes of this Sub-Sublease, the
&#147;<U>Excluded Premises Credit</U>&#148; shall mean the Sub-Sublessor&#146;s pro rata share, based on the
square footage of the Excluded Premises, of the Monthly Installments of Fixed Basic Rent and
Additional Rent (including, but not limited to, any amounts due pursuant to Sections&nbsp;19 and 44 of
the Master Lease) due under the Master Lease.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Condition of the Premises</U>. Sub-Sublessee accepts the Premises in their &#147;AS-IS&#148;
condition as of the date of this Sub-Sublease. None of Sub-Sublessor, Owner or PTI shall have any
obligation to make any improvements or alterations in or to the Premises. Sub-Sublessee
acknowledges that none of Sub-Sublessor, Owner or PTI has made any representations or warranties
regarding the suitability or fitness of the Premises for the conduct of Sub-Sublessee&#146;s business or
for any other purpose except as otherwise set forth in the Master Lease. Sub-Sublessor hereby
acknowledges that the Master Lease allows Sub-Sublessee to make alterations in and to the Premises,
and any alterations undertaken by Sub-Sublessee shall be done in accordance with the Master Lease
Documents. Sub-Sublessor acknowledges that Sub-Sublessee is not assuming responsibility to remove
any alterations or improvements or to restore the Premises to any prior condition to the extent
such alterations or improvements were installed by Sub-Sublessor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Time for Action</U>. If Sub-Sublessee shall at any time fail to make any payment or
perform any other obligation of Sub-Sublessee hereunder, then Sub-Sublessor shall have the right,
but not the obligation, after the lesser of five (5)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice to Sub-Sublessee or
the time within which Owner or PTI, as applicable, may act on Sublessor&#146;s behalf under the Master
Lease Documents, or without notice to Sub-Sublessee in the case of any emergency, and without
waiving or releasing Sub-Sublessee from any obligations of Sub-Sublessee hereunder, to make such
payment or perform such other obligation of Sub-Sublessee in such manner and to such extent as
Sub-Sublessor shall deem necessary, and in exercising any such right, to pay any incidental costs
and expenses, employ attorneys and other professionals, and incur and pay reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees and other costs reasonably required in connection therewith. Sub-Sublessee shall pay to
Sub-Sublessor upon demand all sums so paid by Sub-Sublessor and all incidental costs and expenses
of Sub-Sublessor in connection therewith. For any other acts, the time limits provided for in the
Master Lease for the giving of notice, making of demands, performance of any act, condition or
covenant, or the exercise of any right, remedy or option, are amended for the purposes of this
Sub-Sublease by lengthening or shortening the same in each instance by five (5)&nbsp;days, as
appropriate, so that notices may be given, demands made, or any act, condition or covenant
performed, or any right, remedy or option hereunder exercised, by Sub-Sublessor or Sub-Sublessee,
as the case may be, within the time limit relating thereto contained in the Master Lease. If the
Master Lease allows only five (5)&nbsp;days or less for Sub-Sublessor or Sub-Sublessee to perform any
act, or to undertake to perform such act, or to correct any failure relating to the Premises or
this Sub-Sublease, then such party shall nevertheless be allowed three (3)&nbsp;days to perform such
act, undertake such act and/or correct such failure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Insurance</U>. All liability insurance policies required to be carried by Sub-Sublessee
pursuant to the Master Lease shall name Sub-Sublessor, Owner and PTI as additional insureds.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Notice Addresses</U>. Sub-Sublessor&#146;s address for notices and rent payments shall be &#091; &#093;.
Sub-Sublessee&#146;s address for notices shall c/o Arthrex, Inc., 1370 Creekside Boulevard, Naples,
Florida 34108, Attention: Jon Cheek &#150; Vice President, Finance; Attention: Scott Price &#150; Vice
President, Legal.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Consents, Waivers, Indemnities</U>. Whenever, pursuant to the provisions of the Master
Lease as applicable to this Sub-Sublease, the consent of Sub-Sublessor is required to any act or
thing, the consent of Owner and PTI shall be required, and whenever pursuant thereto liability for
any act, thing, omission, injury or damage is waived or indemnity is provided for the benefit of
Sub-Sublessor, such waiver or indemnity shall extend alike to Owner and PTI, and whenever pursuant
thereto liability for any act, thing, omission, injury or damage is waived or indemnity is provided
for the benefit of &#147;Lessee&#148;, &#147;Sublessee&#148; or &#147;Tenant&#148; thereunder, such waiver or indemnity shall
extend alike to Sub-Sublessee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Protection of Owner and PTI</U>. Sub-Sublessee hereby acknowledges that it has read and
is familiar with all the terms of the Master Lease Documents, and agrees that the rights, title and
estate of Sub-Sublessee are and shall be subordinate and inferior to the rights, title and estate
of Owner, PTI and any mortgagee or ground lessor of Owner or PTI under the Master Lease Documents.
Sub-Sublessee agrees that Owner and PTI shall have the right to directly enforce the terms and
conditions of this Sub-Sublease, including the collection of Rent pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.f. of the
Master Lease. Sub-Sublessee further agrees that if any of the Master Lease Documents terminate for
any reason, Owner or PTI, as applicable, may, at its respective option, either (a)&nbsp;terminate this
Sub-Sublease, or (b)&nbsp;take over all of the right, title and interest of Sub-Sublessor under this
Sub-Sublease, in which case Sub-Sublessee shall attorn to Owner or PTI, as the case may be.
Subject to Section&nbsp;3, hereof, Sub-Sublessee shall be bound by the Master Lease Documents and all
rights of Owner and PTI thereunder, shall not permit any act or thing in or about the Premises or
grant, create or suffer any rights in respect thereof which if done, permitted, granted, created or
suffered by Sub-Sublessor would constitute a breach of the Master Lease Documents, unless otherwise
permitted hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">13.&nbsp;<U>Brokers</U>. Sub-Sublessor and Sub-Sublessee warrant and represent that they have not
dealt with any real estate broker or agent in connection with this Sub-Sublease or its negotiation.
Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from any cost, expense or liability
(including costs of suit and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) for any compensation, commission or fees
claimed by any real estate broker or agent in connection with this Sub-Sublease or its negotiation
by reason of any act of the indemnifying party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">14.&nbsp;<U>Bankruptcy</U>. If a proceeding under any section or chapter of Title 11 of the United
States Code or similar law (the &#147;<U>Bankruptcy Code</U>&#148;) is filed by or against Owner or PTI,
Sub-Sublessor shall not make any election to continue or to terminate the Master Lease without
Sub-Sublessee&#146;s consent. If a proceeding under any section or chapter of the Bankruptcy Code or
similar law is filed by or against Sub-Sublessor, Sub-Sublessor hereby acknowledges and agrees that
Sub-Sublessee will pay Rent and other charges hereunder directly to Owner.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">15.&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>. Sub-Sublessor explicitly acknowledges and agrees that, except to the
extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Sub-Sublessee, Sub-Sublessee shall
have no liability for any act or omission of Sub-Sublessor or any other party (excluding any
employee, agent, vendor, contractor or invitee of Sub-Sublessee) or any costs, expenses,
liabilities or damages imposed upon any of Sub-Sublessee, Sub-Sublessor, Owner or PTI in any way
related to acts, omissions or obligations of Sub-Sublessor or any other party (excluding any
employee, agent, vendor, contractor or invitee of Sub-Sublessee) or which occurred or accrued prior
to the Effective Date, and Sub-Sublessor hereby indemnifies Sub-Sublessee for all such liability,
costs, expenses and damages and agrees to hold Sub-Sublessee harmless therefrom. Sub-Sublessee
explicitly acknowledges and agrees that, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Sub-Sublessor, Sub-Sublessor shall have no liability for any act or omission
of Sub-Sublessee or any employee, agent, vendor, contractor or invitee of Sub-Sublessee or any
costs, expenses, liabilities or damages imposed upon any of Sub-Sublessee, Sub-Sublessor, Owner or
PTI in any way related to acts, omission or obligations of Sub-Sublessee or any employee, agent,
vendor, contractor or invitee of Sub-Sublessee, and Sub-Sublessee hereby indemnifies Sub-Sublessor
for all such liability costs, expenses and damages and agrees to hold Sub-Sublessor harmless
therefrom.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt">16.&nbsp;<U>Excluded Premises</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Sub-Sublease, Sub-Sublessee
acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, Sub-Sublessor shall be entitled to (i)&nbsp;retain
exclusive use and possession of the Excluded Premises, and (ii)&nbsp;ingress and egress to and
nonexclusive use of, in common with Sub-Sublessee, the hallways and other common areas within the

shall be entitled to continue to use and, upon prior written notice, maintain (together with
reasonable access for repairs, if necessary) all existing telephone and computer cables, conduits,
wiring and equipment (&#147;<U>Telecommunications Equipment</U>&#148;) located within the Premises related
to the operation and maintenance of Sub-Sublessee&#146;s telephone and computer equipment; provided
however, such use and maintenance shall not materially interfere with Sub-Sublessor&#146;s use of the
Premises or the Telecommunications Equipment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Sub-Sublessor shall have the right upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice to the
Sub-Sublessee to terminate its use of, and surrender in the condition required under the Master
Lease Documents, the Excluded Premises to the Sub-Sublessee, which such notice shall specify the
date on which the Excluded Premises will be vacated and surrendered by the Sub-Sublessee (the
"<U>Excluded Premises Termination Date</U>&#148;). Commencing on the Excluded Premises Termination

Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: CDOM), an orthopedic medical device company based in Los Angeles,
California, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cardo Medical, LLC (Cardo Medical, Inc. and Cardo Medical,

the transaction contemplated thereby. A majority of Cardo&#146;s stockholders have approved and adopted
the Asset Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Cardo will mail to its
stockholders an information statement describing the terms of the written consent and the asset
sale transaction, which mailing will occur only after the information statement has been filed and
cleared with the SEC staff. &nbsp;The closing of the asset sale transaction will be subject to certain
closing conditions, including that at least 20 calendar days have passed since Cardo mailed the
definitive information statement to its stockholders. &nbsp;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Dr.&nbsp;Andrew Brooks commented, &#147;Arthrex is a global leader in sports medicine which stands at the
pinnacle of innovation for our industry. &nbsp;We look forward to seeing Cardo&#146;s innovative arthroplasty

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>&nbsp;</B>This press release contains &#147;forward-looking statements,&#148; as that term is defined under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), regarding the benefits of the asset sale
transaction, whether the satisfaction of the closing conditions will be met and the asset sale
consummated, that Cardo continues to seek strategic alternatives for its spine division and Cardo&#146;s
plans post-transaction. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the ability of the companies to
satisfy the conditions to the closing of the asset sale and to consummate the asset sale
transaction. In addition, forward-looking statements also may be adversely affected by general
market factors, federal and state regulations and legislation, patent positions and litigation,
among other factors. Cardo&#146;s forward looking statements speak only as the date of this press
release or when made and Cardo does not undertake to update or revise the forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We intend that all
forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the PSLRA.
