Item 3.01 Notice of Failure to Satisfy Continued Listing Standards

On February 2, 2005, clickNsettle.com, Inc. (the "Company") was informed by the
Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE") that the Company's listing thereon would be
suspended as of the close of trading that day. The suspension is due to the fact
that the Company, after the sale of its sole operating business, is no longer in
compliance with the BSE's requirements of $1,000,000 in total assets and
$500,000 in shareholders' equity. However, the BSE has agreed to provide a
90-day extension through May 2, 2005. If the Company were to regain compliance
on or before that day, the Company's stock would not be delisted from the BSE.

The Company continues to search for a new operating business to acquire and
should this transaction be completed prior to May 2, 2005, the Company believes
it would regain compliance with the BSE's requirements. There can be no
assurance that it will find a suitable business.

The Company's common stock continues to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
under the stock symbol CLIK.
