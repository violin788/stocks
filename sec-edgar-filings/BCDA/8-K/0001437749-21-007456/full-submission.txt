<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">On March&nbsp;29, 2021, BioCardia, Inc. (the &#8220;<u>Company</u>&#8221;) and Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (&#8220;<u>Lincoln Park</u>&#8221;) entered into a purchase agreement (the &#8220;<u>Purchase Agreement</u>&#8221;) and a registration rights agreement (the &#8220;<u>Registration Rights Agreement</u>&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company has the right to sell to Lincoln Park shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;<u>Common Stock</u>&#8221;) having an aggregate value of up to $20,000,000 (the &#8220;<u>Purchase Shares</u>&#8221;), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;<u>Offering</u>&#8221;). The Company will control the timing and amount of any sales of Purchase Shares to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">In consideration for entering into the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 75,000 shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;<u>Initial Commitment Shares</u>&#8221;) to Lincoln Park as an initial commitment fee. In addition, the Company agreed to issue to Lincoln Park up to an additional 50,000 shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;<u>Additional Commitment Shares</u>&#8221; and together with the Initial Commitment Shares, the &#8220;<u>Commitment Shares</u>&#8221;) as an additional commitment fee based on a&nbsp;pro-rata&nbsp;percentage of the Purchase Shares issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. The Company will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the Commitment Shares.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">Upon execution of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement on March 29, 2021, the Company sold to Lincoln Park, as an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement, 373,832 shares of common stock, at a per share price of $5.35 per share, for aggregate consideration of $2,000,000, and issued to Lincoln Park the 75,000 Initial Commitment Shares and 5,000 of the Additional Commitment Shares as the pro rata portion of the Additional Commitment Shares issuable in respect of Lincoln Park&#8217;s purchase of $2,000,000 of Purchase Shares in the initial purchase on March 29, 2021.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">In addition to the $2,000,000 initial purchase we completed on March 29, 2021, we have the right in our sole discretion, but not the obligation, from time to time over the&nbsp;36-month&nbsp;term of the Purchase Agreement, to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to an additional aggregate amount of $18,000,000 of shares of Common Stock (subject to certain limitations and conditions), in amounts up to 100,000 shares (the &#8220;<u>Regular Purchase Share Limit</u>&#8221;) of the Common Stock in one or more &#8220;regular purchases&#8221; under the Purchase Agreement (each such purchase, a &#8220;<u>Regular Purchase</u>&#8221;). The Regular Purchase Share Limit will increase to 150,000 shares if the closing price of the Common Stock on the applicable purchase date is not below $5.00 per share and will further increase to 200,000 shares if the closing price of the Common Stock on the applicable purchase date is not below $7.00 per share. In any case, Lincoln Park&#8217;s maximum obligation under any single Regular Purchase will not exceed $2,000,000, unless the Company and Lincoln Park mutually agree to increase the maximum amount of such Regular Purchase. The above-referenced share amount limitations and closing sale price thresholds are subject to adjustment for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for each Regular Purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of the Common Stock immediately preceding the time of sale. There are no upper limits on the price per share that Lincoln Park must pay for shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">If the Company directs Lincoln Park to purchase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Company may sell in a Regular Purchase, then in addition to such Regular Purchase, and subject to certain conditions and limitations in the Purchase Agreement, the Company may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional shares of Common Stock in an &#8220;accelerated purchase&#8221; and an &#8220;additional accelerated purchase&#8221; (including multiple additional accelerated purchases on the same trading day) as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for each accelerated purchase and additional accelerated purchase will be based on market prices of the Common Stock on the applicable purchase date therefor.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">The Purchase Agreement prohibits the Company from directing Lincoln Park to purchase any shares of Common Stock if those shares, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Lincoln Park (as calculated pursuant to Section&nbsp;13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule&nbsp;13d-3&nbsp;thereunder), would result in Lincoln Park beneficially owning more than 9.99% of the then total outstanding shares of Common Stock.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">Under applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company may not issue or sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement more than 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;<u>Exchange Cap</u>&#8221;) (or 3,266,177&nbsp;shares, based on 16,339,061 shares outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement), unless (i) we obtain stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules or (ii) the average price of all applicable sales of our Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement equals or exceeds the lower of (A) the official closing price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock on Nasdaq on the date of the Purchase Agreement and (B) the average official closing price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending on the date of the Purchase Agreement, adjusted such that the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are exempt from the Exchange Cap limitation under applicable Nasdaq rules.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">The Purchase Agreement does not limit the Company&#8217;s ability to raise capital from other sources at its sole discretion, except that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company may not enter into any equity line of credit or similar continuous offering other than with the Investor, excluding an &#8220;at the market offering&#8221; of Common Stock exclusively through one or more registered broker dealers.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">The Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement each contain customary representations, warranties, and agreements of the Company and Lincoln Park, indemnification rights and other obligations of the parties. The Offering of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will terminate on the date that all shares offered by the Purchase Agreement have been sold or, if earlier, the expiration or termination of the Purchase Agreement. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, without fee, penalty or cost to the Company.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of Common Stock.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which shares of Common Stock are sold to Lincoln Park. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement and the amount of such net proceeds will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as to other available and appropriate sources of funding for the Company. The Company expects to use the proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes and working capital.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">The Offering is being made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s effective Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-3&nbsp;(SEC File&nbsp;No.&nbsp;333-249426)&nbsp;(the &#8220;<u>Registration Statement</u>&#8221;), which was previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;<u>SEC</u>&#8221;) on&nbsp;October 9, 2020, and declared effective by the SEC on October 20, 2020. A prospectus supplement related to the Offering dated March 29, 2021 will be filed with the SEC. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, under certain circumstances, if the Registration Statement is no longer available with respect to the Offering, the Company will be required to file additional registration statement(s).</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;margin:0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-variant:normal;text-align:justify;margin:0pt;text-indent:25pt;">We have acted as counsel to BioCardia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;<u>Company</u>&#8221;), in connection with the issuance and sale (i) of 373,832 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the &#8220;<u>Common Stock</u>&#8221;) to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (&#8220;LPC&#8221;) on the date hereof (the &#8220;<u>Initial Purchase Shares</u>&#8221;), (ii) from time to time to LPC of an aggregate offering price of up to an additional $18,000,000 of shares of Common Stock (together with the Initial Purchase Shares, the &#8220;<u>Purchase Shares</u>&#8221;), and (iii)&nbsp; to LPC of up to an additional 125,000 shares of common stock (the &#8220;<u>Commitment Shares</u>&#8221; and together with the Purchase Shares, the &#8220;<u>Shares</u>&#8221;), as contemplated by that certain Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and LPC, dated as of March 29, 2021 (the &#8220;<u>Agreement</u>&#8221;), pursuant to the Company&#8217;s shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-249426) filed on October 9, 2020 and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;<u>Commission</u>&#8221;) on October 20, 2020 (the &#8220;<u>Registration Statement</u>&#8221;).</p>
