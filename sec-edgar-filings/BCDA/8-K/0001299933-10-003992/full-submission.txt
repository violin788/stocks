filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the signature
of the Debtor in such form and in such offices as the Secured Party determines appropriate to
perfect the Security Interest of the Secured Party under this Agreement. Such financing statements
may describe the Collateral in the same manner as described herein or may contain an indication or
description of Collateral that describes such property in any other manner as the Secured Party may
determine, in its sole discretion, is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of
the Security Interest in the Collateral granted herein. Further, in the event that filing a
financing statement in the appropriate state office is not the required means of perfecting the
Security Interest, a photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a
financing statement or other filing or recording document or instrument for filing or recording in
any jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">4.3 <U>Location, Taxes, Loss, Abandonment, Compliance with Laws</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.3.1 All Collateral presently owned or hereafter acquired by Debtor is and will be kept in
its current location, and will not be moved without prior approval of the Secured Party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.3.2 Debtor will promptly pay all taxes levied or assessed against the Collateral, except
when Debtor has a bona fide dispute with any taxing authority; provided that, Debtor promptly gives
written notice of such dispute to the Secured Party and diligently pursues resolution of such
dispute; will promptly notify Secured Party in writing of any material loss to the Collateral; will
not abandon the Collateral; will not use or permit the Collateral to be used for any unlawful
purpose or in violation of any federal, state or municipal law, statute or ordinance.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>REMEDIAL PROVISIONS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.1 <U>General Remedies</U>. Failure of the Debtor to observe or perform any material
covenant or agreement herein, which failure is not cured within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following Debtor&#146;s
receipt of written notice from the Secured Party requesting that Debtor cure such failure, or any
&#147;Event of Default&#148; under the Note, shall constitute an event of default of Debtor hereunder (&#147;<B>Event
of Default</B>&#148;). If an Event of Default shall occur, the Secured Party may exercise, in addition to
all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured
party under the UCC or any other applicable law, subject to the prior rights of any other secured
creditors of Debtor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the prior
rights of any other secured creditors of Debtor, the Secured Party, without demand of performance
or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by law referred to below) to or upon the Debtor or any other person (all and each of which
demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances,
subject to the Security Limit, forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the
Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options
to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to
do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, broker&#146;s board or office of the Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions
as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for
future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Secured Party may disclaim any
warranties of title, possession and quiet enjoyment. The Secured Party shall have the right upon
any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or
sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of
redemption in the Debtor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. The Debtor further
agrees, at the Secured Party&#146;s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the
Secured Party at places which the Secured Party shall reasonably select, whether at the Debtor&#146;s
premises or elsewhere. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Debtor waives all claims,
damages and demands it may acquire against the Secured Party arising out of the exercise by it of
any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims, damages, or demands result solely from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Secured Party. If any notice of a proposed sale
or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable
and proper if given at least ten (10)&nbsp;days before such sale or other disposition.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.2 <U>Application of Proceeds</U>. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Secured Party may apply all or any part of the Collateral or any proceeds of the
Collateral in payment in whole or in part of the Obligations (after deducting all reasonable costs
and expenses of every kind incurred by the Secured Party as a result thereof or incidental to the
care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the rights of the Secured
Party hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements). Any
balance of such proceeds remaining after payment in full of such amounts shall be paid over to the
Debtor, or to whomsoever (if such person is not the Debtor) may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same. Only after (i)&nbsp;the payment by the Secured Party of any other amount required by any
provision of law, including, without limitation, Section&nbsp;9610 and Section&nbsp;9615 of the UCC and (ii)
the payment in full of the Obligations, shall the Secured Party account for the surplus, if any, to
the Debtor, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same (if such person is not the
Debtor).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.3 <U>Waiver, Deficiency</U>. The Debtor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium
now or hereafter in force under any applicable law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of
this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof. The Debtor shall
remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral
are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by
the Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">6.1.1 Upon an Event of Default, and only to the extent that such Event of Default is
continuing, the Debtor will irrevocably constitute and appoint the Secured Party and any officer or

irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of the Debtor and in the name of the Debtor

all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary
or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement after and during such Event of Default.

otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement in accordance with the provisions of

is terminated and the Security Interest created hereby is released.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">6.2 <U>Duty of Secured Party</U>. The Secured Party&#146;s sole duty with respect to the custody,
safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section&nbsp;9207 of
the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Secured Party deals with
similar property for its own account. Neither the Secured Party nor any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any
of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or
otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of the Debtor or any other Person or to take
any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers
conferred on the Secured Party hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Party&#146;s interests in the
Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The
Secured Party shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the
exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
shall be responsible to the Debtor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own
negligence or willful misconduct.

by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1), delay, indulgence, omission or
otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any
default by the Debtor. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising on the part of the
Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the
Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar
to any right or remedy which the Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The
rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are
not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law or equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">7.4 <U>Enforcement Expenses.</U> The Debtor agrees to pay or reimburse the Secured Party for

each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which counterparts taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may also be executed by the parties hereto
exchanging facsimile signed counterparts of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">7.7 <U>Severability</U>. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">7.8 <U>Section&nbsp;Heading</U>. The Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the

full, the Collateral shall be released from the liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all
obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Secured Party
and the Debtor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of

determine, in its sole discretion, is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the perfection of
the Security Interest in the Collateral granted herein. Further, in the event that filing a
financing statement in the appropriate state office is not the required means of perfecting the

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE 5</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>REMEDIAL PROVISIONS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.1 <U>General Remedies</U>. Failure of the Debtor to observe or perform any material
covenant or agreement herein, which failure is not cured within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following Debtor&#146;s
receipt of written notice from the Secured Party requesting that Debtor cure such failure, or any
&#147;Event of Default&#148; under the Note, shall constitute an event of default of Debtor hereunder (&#147;<B>Event
of Default</B>&#148;). If an Event of Default shall occur, the Secured Party may exercise, in addition to
all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured
party under the UCC or any other applicable law, subject to the prior rights of any other secured
creditors of Debtor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the prior
rights of any other secured creditors of Debtor, the Secured Party, without demand of performance
or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by law referred to below) to or upon the Debtor or any other person (all and each of which
demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances,
subject to the Security Limit, forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the
Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options
to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to
do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, broker&#146;s board or office of the Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions
as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for
future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Secured Party may disclaim any
warranties of title, possession and quiet enjoyment. The Secured Party shall have the right upon
any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or
sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of
redemption in the Debtor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. The Debtor further
agrees, at the Secured Party&#146;s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the
Secured Party at places which the Secured Party shall reasonably select, whether at the Debtor&#146;s
premises or elsewhere. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Debtor waives all claims,
damages and demands it may acquire against the Secured Party arising out of the exercise by it of
any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims, damages, or demands result solely from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Secured Party. If any notice of a proposed sale
or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable
and proper if given at least ten (10)&nbsp;days before such sale or other disposition.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.2 <U>Application of Proceeds</U>. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Secured Party may apply all or any part of the Collateral or any proceeds of the
Collateral in payment in whole or in part of the Obligations (after deducting all reasonable costs
and expenses of every kind incurred by the Secured Party as a result thereof or incidental to the
care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the rights of the Secured
Party hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements). Any
balance of such proceeds remaining after payment in full of such amounts shall be paid over to the
Debtor, or to whomsoever (if such person is not the Debtor) may be lawfully entitled to receive the
same. Only after (i)&nbsp;the payment by the Secured Party of any other amount required by any
provision of law, including, without limitation, Section&nbsp;9610 and Section&nbsp;9615 of the UCC and (ii)
the payment in full of the Obligations, shall the Secured Party account for the surplus, if any, to
the Debtor, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same (if such person is not the
Debtor).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">5.3 <U>Waiver, Deficiency</U>. The Debtor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium
now or hereafter in force under any applicable law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of
this Agreement or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof. The Debtor shall
remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral
are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by
the Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement in accordance with the provisions of

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement following and during the continuance of an Event of Default

by virtue hereof in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U>. All powers, authorizations and agencies

similar property for its own account. Neither the Secured Party nor any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any
of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or
otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of the Debtor or any other Person or to take
any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers
conferred on the Secured Party hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Party&#146;s interests in the
Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The
Secured Party shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the
exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
shall be responsible to the Debtor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for its own
negligence or willful misconduct.

by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1), delay, indulgence, omission or
otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any
default by the Debtor. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising on the part of the
Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the
Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar
to any right or remedy which the Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The
rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are
not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law or equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">7.4 <U>Enforcement Expenses.</U> The Debtor agrees to pay or reimburse the Secured Party for

respective successors and assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">7.6 <U>Counterparts; Facsimile</U>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which counterparts taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may also be executed by the parties hereto
exchanging facsimile signed counterparts of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">7.7 <U>Severability</U>. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">7.8 <U>Section&nbsp;Heading</U>. The Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">7.10 <U>Governing Law.</U> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of California and the parties hereby submit to the

California in connection with any dispute which may arise under this Agreement or its
implementation or enforcement.

counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Note, (b)&nbsp;the Secured
Party does not have any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Debtor arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, and the relationship between the Debtor and the Secured Party in
connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor, and (c)&nbsp;no joint venture,
agency or partnership is created hereby or by the Note or otherwise exists by virtue of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">7.12 <U>Release of Collateral.</U> At such time as the Obligations shall have been paid in
full, the Collateral shall be released from the liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all
obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Secured Party
and the Debtor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of
any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Debtor. At the request
and sole expense of the Debtor following any such termination, the Secured Party shall deliver to
the Debtor any Collateral held by the Secured Party hereunder, and execute and deliver to the
