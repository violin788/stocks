<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;18, 2008, clickNsettle.com, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a Merger Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with Cardo Medical, LLC, a California limited liability
company (&#147;Cardo Medical&#148;), and Cardo Acquisition, LLC, a California limited liability company and
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;). The Agreement provides for the acquisition
of Cardo Medical by the Company through a merger of Cardo Medical with Merger Sub, with Cardo
Medical continuing as the surviving entity in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company. Pursuant to the Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding units of Cardo Medical&#146;s
membership interests will be converted into the right to receive shares of the common stock of the
Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with the signing of the Agreement, Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost, chairman and chief
executive officer of Opko Health, Inc., and other investors (the &#147;Frost Investors&#148;) invested $9.5
million in Cardo Medical in exchange for units of Cardo Medical&#146;s membership interests. Certain
other investors (the &#147;Additional Investors,&#148; and together with the Frost Investors, the &#147;New
Investors&#148;) will invest up to an additional $4.0&nbsp;million in Cardo Medical before the consummation
of the merger. Proceeds from these investments are expected to be used to close on the acquisition
of the outstanding equity interests of three partially owned subsidiaries of Cardo Medical (the
&#147;Acquisitions&#148;), and to enable Cardo Medical to accelerate its research and product development.
Following the Acquisitions, Cardo Medical will directly and indirectly own 100% of the equity
interests of Accelerated Innovation, LLC, Cervical Xpand, LLC and Uni-Knee, LLC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Agreement, at the closing of the merger, each Cardo Medical unit issued
and outstanding shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 655,337.128 shares
of common stock of the Company, subject to adjustment. As a result of the merger, it is expected
that the Company&#146;s stockholders will own approximately 5.56% of the combined company on a fully
diluted basis. Additionally, after the closing of the merger, the current members of Cardo
Medical, i.e., the members of Cardo Medical prior to the admission of the New Investors, will own
between 64.44% and 66.67% of the capital stock of the Company and the New Investors will own
between 27.78% and 30.0% of the capital stock of the Company, in each case, depending on the total
amount of the investment in Cardo Medical by the Additional Investors prior to the merger.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as a condition that Cardo
Medical shall have closed on the Acquisitions and shall have received a minimum $3.0&nbsp;million
investment by the Additional Investors. Subject to these and other conditions, the Company expects
the merger to close during the third quarter of 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following completion of the merger, the Company will submit to its stockholders for approval
an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Cardo Medical, Inc. The
Company intends to apply to have its shares listed on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). In
addition, following completion of the merger, the board of directors of Cardo Medical will consist
of five directors to be appointed by Dr.&nbsp;Andrew Brooks and two directors to be appointed by Dr.
Frost. Dr.&nbsp;Brooks, an orthopedic surgeon and the president and chief executive officer of Cardo
Medical, will be the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. The Company will be
headquartered in Los Angeles.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary discussion of material terms of the Agreement set forth above is qualified by
reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is attached as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;2.1</U> to this report and
is incorporated herein by reference.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;19, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of the Agreement
and the related transactions described herein, which press release is attached as <U>Exhibit
99.1</U> to this report.

qualified to do business. Cardo does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;The Escrow Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with respect to the Escrowed Property.
If any dispute arises as to whether the Escrow Agent is obligated to deliver the Escrowed Property
or as to whom the Escrowed Property is to be delivered or the amount thereof, the Escrow Agent
shall not be required to make any delivery, but in such event, the Escrow Agent may hold the
Escrowed Property until receipt by the Escrow Agent of instructions in writing, signed by all
parties which have, or claim to have, an interest in the Escrowed Property, directing the
disposition of the Escrowed Property, or in the absence of such authorization, the Escrow Agent may
hold the Escrowed Property until receipt of a certified copy of a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed Property. The Escrow Agent
may require, as a condition to the disposition of the Escrowed Property pursuant to written
instructions, indemnification and/or opinions of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Escrow Agent, from each party providing such instructions. If such written instructions,
indemnification and opinions are not received, or proceedings for such determination are not
commenced, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of notice of any such dispute
and diligently continued, or if the Escrow Agent is uncertain as to which party or parties are
entitled to the Escrowed Property, Escrow Agent may either (i)&nbsp;hold the Escrowed Property until
receipt of (X)&nbsp;such written instructions and indemnification or (Y)&nbsp;a certified copy of a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed
Property, or (ii)&nbsp;deposit the Escrowed Property in the registry of a court of competent
jurisdiction; <I>provided, however, </I>that notwithstanding the foregoing, Escrow Agent may, but shall
not be required to, institute legal proceedings of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified
pursuant to the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;16</U> hereof for all costs and reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees incurred by it in its capacity as escrow agent in connection with any such action and shall be
fully protected in suspending all or any part of its activities under this Escrow Agreement until a
final judgment in such action is resolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon the giving of thirty (30)&nbsp;days written notice
to the other parties of this Escrow Agreement. Upon such resignation, CNS and the Members&#146;
Representatives shall jointly appoint a successor escrow agent, who shall assume the
duties of Escrow Agent hereunder by supplement hereto. If a successor escrow agent is not
appointed within ten (10)&nbsp;days after notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court
of competent jurisdiction to name a successor escrow agent. CNS and the Members&#146;

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned (the &#147;Investor&#148;) is delivering this letter to clickNsettle.com, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), in connection with the Investor&#146;s acquisition of shares of
capital stock of the Company (the &#147;Securities&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Investor understands that the sale of the Securities has not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and such Securities are being offered and
sold pursuant to a specific exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, the
availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment
intent and the accuracy of the Investor&#146;s representations as expressed herein or otherwise made
pursuant hereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Investor is acquiring the Securities for investment for the Investor&#146;s own account, not as
a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Investor (a)&nbsp;is an &#147;accredited investor&#148; within the meaning of Regulation&nbsp;D, Rule 501(a)
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as certified by such Investor&#146;s initials on
the attached Accredited Investor Certification, or (b)&nbsp;either alone, or the Investor with his, her
or its &#147;purchaser representative,&#148; within the meaning of Regulation&nbsp;D, Rule 501(h) under the
Securities Act, has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so that the
Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of his, her or its investment in the Company
and has the capacity to protect his, her or its own interests. The Investor (i)&nbsp;has adequate means
of providing for such Investor&#146;s current needs and possible personal contingencies, (ii)&nbsp;has no
present need for liquidity in such Investor&#146;s investment, (iii)&nbsp;is able to bear the substantial
economic risks of an investment in the Securities for an indefinite period and (iv)&nbsp;at the present
time, can afford a complete loss of such investment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Investor acknowledges that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless subsequently
registered for resale under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act is available. The Investor further understands that there is no
assurance that any exemption from registration under the Securities Act will be available or, if
available, that such exemption will allow the Investor to dispose of or otherwise transfer any or
all of the Securities under the circumstances, in the amounts or at the times the Investor might
propose.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Investor understands and agrees that the certificates evidencing the Securities shall bear
the legends relating to restrictions on transfer under federal and state securities laws and
legends required under applicable state securities laws.

</DIV>



<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>CLICKNSETTLE.COM, INC. AND CARDO MEDICAL, LLC<BR>
ANNOUNCE MERGER AGREEMENT</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Miami, FL and Los Angeles, CA &#150;June&nbsp;18, 2008 </B>&#150; Cardo Medical, LLC, a company engaged in the
development of orthopedic medical devices, and clickNsettle.com, Inc. (OTCBB: CKST), a
publicly-traded company with no active operations, have signed a merger agreement pursuant to which
Cardo Medical will become a wholly owned subsidiary of clickNsettle. After the merger is
completed, clickNsettle will be renamed Cardo Medical, Inc., and will be headquartered in Los
Angeles. The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2008, and the company intends
thereafter to apply to have its shares listed on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with the signing of the merger agreement, Dr.&nbsp;Phillip Frost, former chairman
and chief executive officer of IVAX Corporation, and others invested $9.5&nbsp;million in Cardo Medical.
Certain other investors will make up to an additional $4&nbsp;million investment in Cardo Medical
before the merger is consummated. Proceeds from these investments are expected to be used to close
on the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests of three partially owned subsidiaries of
Cardo Medical, and to enable Cardo Medical to accelerate its research and product development.
Following such acquisitions, Cardo Medical will directly and indirectly own 100% of the equity
interests of Accelerated Innovation, LLC, Cervical Xpand, LLC and Uni-Knee, LLC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the merger agreement, it is expected that clickNsettle shareholders will
own approximately 5.56% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis upon consummation of the
merger. The current holders of Cardo Medical&#146;s membership interests will own between 64.44% and
66.67% of clickNsettle following the merger, and the new investors in Cardo Medical will own
between 27.78% and 30.0% of clickNsettle following the merger, in each case, depending on the total
amount of the investment in Cardo Medical prior to the merger. The merger is subject to customary
covenants and several conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the merger, the board of directors of Cardo Medical, Inc. will consist of five
directors to be appointed by Dr.&nbsp;Andrew Brooks and two directors to be appointed by Dr.&nbsp;Phillip
Frost. Dr.&nbsp;Brooks, an orthopedic surgeon and the president and CEO of Cardo Medical, will be the
CEO of the company following the merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Brooks commented, &#147;Cardo Medical is excited to partner with the Frost investors as we view
their investment as a significant endorsement of our current product portfolio and validation of
our forthcoming product pipeline.&#148; Glenn&nbsp;L. Halpryn, who is the current chairman and president of
clickNsettle, stated that Cardo Medical&#146;s scientific and management team has extensive experience
in the orthopedic device space. Mr.&nbsp;Halpryn also said that he is pleased that clickNsettle has
this opportunity to enter the orthopedic medical device market, which he believes has growth
potential in view of the demographic trend of an aging population.
