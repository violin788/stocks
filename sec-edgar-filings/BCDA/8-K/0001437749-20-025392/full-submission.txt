<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;">This letter (the &#8220;<b>Agreement</b>&#8221;) constitutes the agreement between A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the &#8220;<b>Placement</b> <b>Agent</b>&#8221;) and BioCardia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;<b>Company</b>&#8221;), that the Placement Agent shall serve as the exclusive placement agent for the Company, on a &#8220;reasonable best efforts&#8221; basis, in connection with the proposed placement (the &#8220;<b>Placement</b>&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;<b>Common Stock</b>&#8221; or the &#8220;<b>Securities</b>&#8221;). The Securities actually placed by the Placement Agent are referred to herein as the &#8220;<b>Placement</b><b> </b><b>Agent</b> <b>Securities</b>.&#8221; The terms of the Placement shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the purchasers (each, a &#8220;<b>Purchaser</b>&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;<b>Purchasers</b>&#8221;), and nothing herein constitutes that the Placement Agent would have the power or authority to bind the Company or any Purchaser, or an obligation for the Company will issue any Securities or complete the Placement. The Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Placement Agent&#8217;s obligations hereunder are on a reasonable best efforts basis only and that the execution of this Agreement does not constitute a commitment by the Placement Agent to purchase the Securities and does not ensure the successful placement of the Securities or any portion thereof or the success of the Placement Agent with respect to securing any other financing on behalf of the Company. The Placement Agent may retain other brokers or dealers to act as sub-agents or selected-dealers on its behalf in connection with the Placement; provided, however, that the Company shall first approve any such sub-agents. Certain affiliates of the Placement Agent may participate in the Placement by purchasing some of the Placement Agent Securities. The sale of Placement Agent Securities to any Purchaser will be evidenced by a securities purchase agreement (the &#8220;<b>Purchase</b> <b>Agreement</b>&#8221;) between the Company and such Purchaser, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Purchaser. Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement. Prior to the signing of any Purchase Agreement, officers of the Company will be available to answer inquiries from prospective Purchasers.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;"><u>SECTION 3</u>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>COMPENSATION</u>. In consideration of the services to be provided for hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Placement Agent and/or its respective designees a cash fee of 7% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from the sale of the Placement Agent Securities (the &#8220;<b>Cash Fee</b>&#8221;). The Cash Fee shall be paid on the Closing Date. The Company shall not be required to pay the Placement Agent any fees or expenses except for the Cash Fee, the reimbursement of up to $40,000 in legal expenses and clearing agent fees and expenses, and the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses of the Placement Agent in connection with marketing the transaction (i.e., roadshow expenses, background checks, tombstones, etc.), with respect to the engagement hereunder; provided, however, that the reimbursement of legal, and out of pocket expenses of the Placement Agent shall not exceed $40,000 in the aggregate; provided, further, that this sentence in no way limits or impairs the indemnification or contribution provisions contained herein. The Placement Agent reserves the right to reduce any item of compensation or adjust the terms thereof as specified herein in the event that a determination shall be made by FINRA to the effect that the Placement Agent&#8217;s aggregate compensation is in excess of FINRA Rules or that the terms thereof require adjustment.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;"><u>SECTION 4</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>INDEMNIFICATION</u>.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent permitted by law, with respect to the Placement Agent Securities, the Company will indemnify the Placement Agent and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, members and controlling persons (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) against all losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities, as the same are incurred (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), relating to or arising out of its activities hereunder or pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) are found in a final judgment (not subject to appeal) by a court of law to have resulted primarily and directly from the Placement Agent&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing the services described herein.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:72pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt;">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly after receipt by the Placement Agent of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which the Placement Agent is entitled to indemnity hereunder, the Placement Agent will notify the Company in writing of such claim or of the commencement of such action or proceeding, but failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any obligation it may have hereunder, except and only to the extent such failure results in the forfeiture by the Company of substantial rights and defenses. If the Company so elects or is requested by the Placement Agent, the Company will assume the defense of such action or proceeding and will employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Placement Agent and will pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Placement Agent will be entitled to employ counsel separate from counsel for the Company and from any other party in such action if counsel for the Placement Agent reasonably determines that it would be inappropriate under the applicable rules of professional responsibility for the same counsel to represent both the Company and the Placement Agent. In such event, the reasonable fees and disbursements of no more than one such separate counsel will be paid by the Company, in addition to fees of local counsel.

Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience only, each Purchaser and its respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through the legal counsel of the Placement Agent. The legal counsel of the Placement Agent does not represent any of the Purchasers and only represents the Placement Agent. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other Transaction Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company and the Purchasers collectively and not between and among the Purchasers.</p>
