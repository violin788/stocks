On March 18, 2011, Cardo Medical, Inc. (the "Company") entered into the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2011, with Arthrex, Inc. ("Arthrex") and Cardo Medical, LLC ("Cardo LLC") (collectively referred to as the Asset Purchase Agreement).  The first amendment modifies the definition of "End Date" so that it means May 24, 2011; provided that if (i) the closing has not occurred by reason of the failure to satisfy the condition in the Asset Purchase Agreement that at least 20 calendar days have passed since an Information Statement has been filed with the SEC and transmitted to every record holder of shares of the Company, but (ii) the SEC has cleared the Company's responses to the SEC's comment letter and no unresolved comments are pending before the SEC with respect to the Information Statement on or before such date, then the End Date shall be June 24, 2011.  Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Arthrex can terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement if certain conditions have not been fulfilled or waived by the End Date. <br><br>No other terms of the original Asset Purchase Agreement were modified by the first amendment.  The description of the first amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of such agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. <br><br>Additionally, the information set forth in Item 2.03 is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

<FONT SIZE="2">
	On March 18, 2011, the Company and Cardo LLC executed a Secured Promissory Note in favor of Arthrex (the "Arthrex Note").  Under the terms of the Arthrex Note, the $250,000 deposit made by Arthex on January 24, 2011 pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement constitutes an initial loan.  Under the terms of the Arthrex Note, Arthrex will (a) make a second loan to the Company and Cardo LLC of such amount to repay the indebtedness owed to Jon Brooks in the principal amount of $300,000 plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (the "Brooks Payoff Amount") and the indebtedness owed to Earl Brien, M.D. in the principal amount of $200,000 plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (the "Brien Payoff Amount"), and (b) make additional advances within two business days of the written request of the Company and Cardo LLC; provided that in no event shall the aggregate principal amount loaned under the Arthrex Note at any time exceed $1,250,000.  Pursuant to the Arthrex Note, the Company and Cardo LLC promise to repay to Arthrex the principal amount outstanding from time to time on the Arthrex Note together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the maturity date.  The maturity date shall mean the earlier of: (i) the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, (ii) the fifth day following the termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to its terms, and (iii) the End Date (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement).  Interest on the unpaid principal amount due under the Arthrex Note accrues at an interest rate of 6% per annum; provided that if an event of default occurs interest on the unpaid principal amount due under the Arthrex Note shall increase to an interest rate of 12% per annum. <br><br>	The proceeds obtained by the Company and Cardo LLC under the Arthrex Note shall be used to pay off the Brooks Payoff Amount and the Brien Payoff Amount and satisfy all obligations under the notes and security agreements relating to such indebtedness, and for ordinary course working capital needs of the Company's and Cardo LLC's joint reconstructive business.<br><br>	Pursuant to the Arthrex Note, the Company and Cardo LLC granted, pledged and assigned to Arthrex a security interest in any and all assets (including, the acquired assets as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement), goods, inventories, properties and business of the Company and Cardo LLC, either tangible, intangible, real, personal, mixed, together with all proceeds or products thereof including, without limitation, all leasehold interests, all payments under insurance, or any indemnity, warranty or guaranty, which security interest shall rank senior to and have priority over those held by all other creditors of the Company and Cardo LLC.<br>The following events trigger an event of default under the Arthrex Note: (i) failure by the Company or Cardo LLC to make any payment when due under the Arthrex Note, which payment remains unpaid after three business days following the due date; (ii) the Company or Cardo LLC fail to observe any covenant when due under the Arthrex Note, which failure, if curable, remains uncured after ten business days following written notice; (iii) the appointment of a receiver for any part of the Company's or Cardo LLC's property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against the Company or Cardo LLC (provided that in any involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, that such proceeding is not dismissed or discharged within 30 days of the initiation of such proceeding); (iv) commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings by any creditor of the Company or Cardo LLC or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the loan; or (v) a material adverse change occurs in the Company's or Cardo LLC's financial condition.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Arthrex may declare the entire unpaid principal balance under this Arthrex Note and all accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable without notice, demand or presentment. <br><br>	The foregoing summary is a summary of the Arthrex Note and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Arthrex Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.<br><br>

for ordinary course working capital needs of Maker&#146;s Reconstructive business only;
<U>provided</U>, that the proceeds from the Second Loan shall be used by Maker solely to pay-off
and fully satisfy all amounts owed pursuant to that certain Secured Promissory Note dated November

from each of Brooks and Brien, in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Payee,
that (i)&nbsp;reflects the amounts required in order to pay in full the indebtedness owed under the

made by Maker hereunder shall be applied (i)&nbsp;first to reimburse Payee for any costs or expenses
incurred by Payee in connection with the enforcement of any of its rights under this Note, then
(ii)&nbsp;to interest accrued through the date of such payment, and then (iii)&nbsp;in satisfaction of
outstanding principal. All proceeds from the sale of Maker&#146;s Spine division (&#147;<U>Spine

Agreement), goods, inventories, properties and business of Maker, either tangible, intangible,
real, personal, mixed, whether now owned or hereafter acquired and wherever located, together with
all proceeds or products thereof including, without limitation, all leasehold interests, all
payments under insurance (whether or not Payee is the loss payee thereof), or any indemnity,
warranty or guaranty, payable by reason of loss or damage or otherwise with respect thereto,
together with all substitutions, replacements, additions and accessions therefor or thereto
(collectively, the &#147;<U>Collateral</U>&#148;), which security interest shall rank senior to and have
priority over those held by all other creditors of Maker, including but not limited to Earl Brien,
M.D., an individual, and Jon Brooks, an individual. Maker consents and agrees that Payee may file
one or more financing statements as necessary to evidence or perfect the security interest in the
Collateral granted hereby.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Each of the following shall constitute an event of default (&#147;<U>Event of Default</U>&#148;) under
this Note: (i)&nbsp;Maker fails to make any payment when due under this Note, which payment remains

covenant when due under this Note, which failure, if curable, remains uncured after ten (10)
business days following written notice thereof; (ii)&nbsp;the appointment of a receiver for any part of
Maker&#146;s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the

(provided that in any involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, that such proceeding is not
dismissed or discharged within 30&nbsp;days of the initiation of such proceeding); (iii)&nbsp;commencement of
foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or
any other method, by any creditor of Maker or by any governmental agency against any collateral

an Event of Default, Payee may declare the entire unpaid principal balance under this Note and all
accrued unpaid interest immediately due and payable without notice, demand or presentment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Maker hereby waives presentment for payment, protest and demand, notice of protest, demand
and/or dishonor, and any other notice otherwise required to be given under law, which may be
lawfully waived, in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default, enforcement or
collection of this Note. Maker expressly agrees that this Note may be extended or subordinated, by
forbearance or otherwise, from time to time, without in any way affecting the liability of Maker.
No consent or waiver by Payee with respect to any action or failure to act which without such
consent or waiver would constitute a breach of any provision of this Note shall be valid and
binding unless in writing signed by Payee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Maker shall pay Payee all costs and expenses incurred by Payee in connection with the
collection of this Note, or the enforcement of Payee&#146;s rights hereunder, including court costs and
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and legal costs, unless prohibited by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">Every provision of this Note is intended to be severable. If any clause, phrase, provision or
portion of this Note or the application thereof is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining clauses, phrases, provisions and
portions of this Note shall not be affected or impaired thereby, but each remaining clause, phrase,
provision and portion shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">No waiver by Payee of any right or remedy under this Note shall be effective unless in a
writing signed by Payee. Neither the failure nor any delay in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Note will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege and no single
or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege by Payee will preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power or privilege.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">This Note will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to conflicts of
laws principles.

of Florida; and Maker and Payee consent to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court and waives
any argument that venue in such forum is not convenient. In the event Maker commences any action
in another jurisdiction or venue under any tort or contract theory arising directly or indirectly
from the relationship created by this Note, or alleging any breach of this Note, Payee at its
option is entitled to have the case transferred to one of the jurisdictions and venues described
above, or if such transfer cannot be accomplished under applicable law, to have such case dismissed
without prejudice. Maker agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%">MAKER AND PAYEE HEREBY EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS NOTE OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT,
DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE, AND EACH AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION

consent of Maker.
