<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;19, 2007, clickNsettle.com, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with the purchasers identified on Exhibit&nbsp;A thereto (the &#147;Purchasers&#148;).
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will, subject to stockholder approval, implement a
one-for-ten reverse stock split, increase its authorized capital stock to 800&nbsp;million shares of
capital stock, consisting of 750&nbsp;million shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company
and 50&nbsp;million shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company, and sell to the
Purchasers an aggregate number of unregistered shares equal to 51% of the post-reverse split
outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis (the &#147;Shares&#148;). The
purchase price for the sale of the Shares will be an amount equal to net cash and cash equivalents
of the Company on the Closing Date, after deducting any and all liabilities and costs existing as
of the Closing Date, including costs and expenses of this transaction. The Company expects that the
Closing Date will occur during the first quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company and the Purchasers entered into a First Amendment to the
Agreement (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) that extended the date by which the Company must obtain stockholder
approval of certain proposals contained in the Agreement from December&nbsp;31, 2007 to January&nbsp;31,
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descriptions of the Agreement and the Amendment in this report are summaries
that do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
Agreement and the Amendment which are filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by this
reference.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;31, 2008, the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) of the Company, in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law, unanimously adopted the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Company. The Amended and Restated Bylaws became effective immediately upon their adoption by the
Board. A description of the changes to the Bylaws is provided below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board amended and restated in its entirety the title of the Company&#146;s Bylaws to read
&#147;Amended and Restated Bylaws of clickNsettle.com, Inc.&#148; Previously, the title of the Company&#146;s
Bylaws read &#147;By-laws of NAM Corporation.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Board amended and restated the provision of Article&nbsp;I, Section&nbsp;6 of the
Bylaws that required that any corporate action other than the election of Directors be authorized
by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders, in order to conform with Article&nbsp;II,
Section&nbsp;1 of the Bylaws, which states that the business, property, and affairs of the Company will
be managed by or under the direction of the Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board amended and restated Article&nbsp;II, Section&nbsp;1 of the Bylaws so that the number of
Directors of the Company shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board. Previously,
the number of Directors was fixed at six Directors, provided, however, that the Board, by
resolution adopted by a vote of a majority of the then authorized number of Directors, was
authorized to increase or decrease the number of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Board amended and restated Sections&nbsp;1, 2 and 7 of Article&nbsp;IV of the Bylaws to
permit the Company to issue both certificated and uncertificated shares of stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of the changes to the Bylaws in this report is a summary that does not purport
to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bylaws which are filed as an
exhibit hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.
