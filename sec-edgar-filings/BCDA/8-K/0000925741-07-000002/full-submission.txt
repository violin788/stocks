ITEM 4.01  CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

     On October 2, 2007, BP Audit Group, PLLC ("BP") resigned as the
Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting Firm for clickNsettle.com,
Inc. (the "Company").

     The reports of BP on the Company's financial statements for the years
ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 express substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern because the Company has no operating
business.  The reports of BP did not otherwise contain an adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles.

     During the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and through October 2,
2007, there were no disagreements with BP, whether or not resolved, on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
BP, would have caused BP to make reference thereto in their reports on the
financial statements for such years.

     During the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and through October 2,
2007, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K).

     The Company has provided a copy of the foregoing disclosure to BP, and
BP has furnished the Company with a copy of a letter addressed to the
Securities and Exchange Commission stating that BP agrees with the above
statements as they apply to BP.  A copy of BP's letter is attached as an
exhibit to this Form 8-K.

     On October 3, 2007, the Company engaged Pender Newkirk & Company LLP as
the Company's principal accountant to audit the Company's financial
statements.  The Company has not consulted with Pender Newkirk & Company LLP
on the application of accounting principles, the type of audit opinion that
might be rendered or any other matter set forth in Item 304(a)(2) of
Regulation S-B.
