(the &#8220;Company&#8221;) entered into a Credit Agreement (the &#8220;New Credit Agreement&#8221;), by and among the Company, as borrower, the several lenders from time to time party thereto (the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;), and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221;). The New Credit Agreement replaces the Company&#8217;s existing Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July&#160;1, 2020, by and among the Company, as borrower, CoStar Realty Information, Inc., as <span style="white-space:nowrap">co-borrower,</span> the several lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Company has ordinary course banking relationships with the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Credit Agreement provides for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1&#160;billion, with a letter of credit sublimit of $20&#160;million. Borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate, which can be, at the Company&#8217;s option, either (a)&#160;an alternate base rate plus an applicable rate ranging from 0.125% to 0.750% or (b)&#160;a Term SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR rate for the specified interest period plus an applicable rate ranging from 1.125% to 1.750%, in each case depending on the Company&#8217;s Debt Rating (as defined in the New Credit Agreement). The New Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature five years after the Closing Date. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants for transactions of this type, including, among others, the provision of financial and other information to the administrative agent, notice to the administrative agent upon the occurrence of certain material events, preservation of existence, maintenance of properties, and compliance with laws, including environmental laws, subject to certain exceptions. The New Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to merge and consolidate with other companies, restrictions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability of the Company and certain subsidiaries to grant liens or security interests on assets, subject to certain exceptions. The New Credit Agreement contains a financial maintenance covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) of less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00, tested at the end of each fiscal quarter. The New Credit Agreement also provides for a number of customary events of default, including, among others: payment defaults to the Lenders, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, covenant defaults, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, cross-acceleration to other material indebtedness, certain change of control events, and material money judgments and other customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations and the termination of lending commitments under the New Credit Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing summary of the New Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the New Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. </p> <p style="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>
