provided in this Agreement, the parties intend that the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for each Taxable Year shall measure the decrease or increase (respectively) in the actual liability for Taxes of the Corporation for such Taxable
Year that is attributable to the Tax Assets, determined using a &#147;with and without&#148; methodology (that is, treating the Tax Assets as the last tax attributes used in such Taxable Year). The actual liability for Taxes of the Corporation shall
be determined by the Corporation using such reasonable methods as the Corporation determines; <U>provided</U> that the Corporation shall use the following assumptions in making the determination: </P>

to Adjusted Assets for the Corporation in the year of payment, and, as a result, such additional Basis Adjustments shall be incorporated into the current year calculation and into future year calculations, as appropriate. </P>

the deduction of the portion of each Tax Benefit Payment that is accounted for as Imputed Interest under the Code due to the characterization of such Tax Benefit Payments as additional consideration payable by the Corporation for the Units acquired
in an Exchange. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Carryovers and Carrybacks</U>. Carryovers or carrybacks of any Tax Items
attributable to the Tax Assets shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any
Tax Item includes a portion that is attributable to a Tax Asset and another portion that is not, the portion attributable to the Tax Asset shall be considered to be used in accordance with the &#147;with and without&#148; methodology. </P>

rates applicable to that income and gain, with such weighted average determined by multiplying (A)&nbsp;the tax rate for each jurisdiction in which the Corporation pays Taxes by (B)&nbsp;the apportionment factor with respect to that jurisdiction for

Tax Item includes a portion that is attributable to a Tax Asset and another portion that is not, the portion attributable to the Tax Asset shall be considered to be used in accordance with the &#147;with and without&#148; methodology. </P>
