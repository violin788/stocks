denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates
for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change. The
London interbank offered rate (&#147;<U>LIBOR</U>&#148;) is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. On March&nbsp;5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority (&#147;<U>FCA</U>&#148;) publicly announced that: (a)&nbsp;immediately after December&nbsp;31, 2021, publication of all seven Euro LIBOR settings, all seven Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the spot next,

There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies
and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. Each party to this Agreement should consult its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments. Public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative
reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event, a Term ESTR Transition Event or an Early <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Opt-In</FONT> Election, Section&nbsp;2.14(b)
and (c)&nbsp;provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.14(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans
is based. However, the Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the
definition of &#147;LIBOR Rate&#148; (or &#147;EURIBOR Rate&#148; or &#147;AUD Rate&#148;, as applicable) or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i)&nbsp;any such

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.9 <U>Severability</U>. It is expressly understood and agreed that if any provision of this
Agreement or the application of any such provision to any party or circumstance shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any party or circumstance other than those to which it is so determined to be invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision hereof shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law so long as the
economic or legal substance of the matters contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares or finds that any term or provision hereof
is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or portion of the term or provision, or to delete specific words or
phrases, and to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified. If such court of competent jurisdiction does not so replace an invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the matters contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.10 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement and any amendments may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts and delivered via
facsimile or .pdf, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same document. The signature of any party to any counterpart shall be deemed a signature to, and may be appended to, any
other counterpart. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.11 <U>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</U>. Each Partnership Unitholder on the date hereof is expected to become a party to
this Agreement. Each of their Permitted Transferees and each Person who is or becomes a Partnership Unitholder may become a party hereto, subject to their execution and delivery to the Partnership and the Company of an executed joinder to this
Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Partnership and the Company. This Agreement is not otherwise intended to, and does not, provide or create any rights or benefits in any Person. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.12 <U>Mutual Drafting</U>. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been advised by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated
hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied
to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.13 <U>Rights and
Remedies Cumulative</U>. The rights and remedies provided by this Agreement are cumulative and the use of any one right or remedy by any party shall not preclude or waive the right to use any or all other remedies. Such rights and remedies are given
in addition to any other rights the parties may have by law, statute, ordinance or otherwise. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.14 <U>Amendment</U>. The provisions of this Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing approved by the affirmative vote or
written or electronic consent of each of (i)&nbsp;the Company, (ii)&nbsp;the Partnership, and (iii)&nbsp;Partnership Unitholders holding a majority of the then outstanding Class&nbsp;C Units; <I>provided </I>that no amendment may disproportionately
and adversely affect the rights of a Partnership Unitholder in respect of the Class&nbsp;C Units compared to the rights of other Partnership Unitholders in respect of the Class&nbsp;C Units without the consent of such affected Partnership Unitholder
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.15 <U>Specific Performance</U>. The parties recognize that irreparable injury will result from a breach of any provision of this Agreement
and that money damages would be inadequate to fully remedy the injury. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, any party that may be injured (in addition to any other remedies
that may be available to that party) shall be entitled (without the need to post any bond, surety, or other security) to one or more preliminary or permanent orders (a)&nbsp;restraining and enjoining any act that would constitute a breach or
(b)&nbsp;compelling the performance of any obligation that, if not performed, would constitute a breach. </P>
